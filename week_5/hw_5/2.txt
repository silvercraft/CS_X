TODAY it seems to me providential that Fate should have chosen
Braunau on the Inn as my birthplace. For this little town lies on the boundary
between two German states which we of the younger generation at least have
made it our life work to reunite by every means at our disposal.German-Austria must return to the great German mother country,
and not because of any economic considerations. No, and again no: even if
such a union were unimportant from an economic point of view; yes, even
if it were harmful, it must nevertheless take place. One blood demands one
Reich. Never will the German nation possess the moral right to engage in
colonial politics until, at least, it embraces its own sons within a single
state. Only when the Reich borders include the very last German, but can
no longer guarantee his daily bread, will the moral right to acquire foreign
soil arise from the distress of our own people. Their sword will become
our plow, and from the tears of war the daily bread of future generations
will grow. And so this little city on the border seems to me the symbol
of a great mission. And in another respect as well, it looms as an admonition
to the present day. More than a hundred years ago, this insignificant place
had the distinction of being immortalized in the annals at least of German
history, for it was the scene of a tragic catastrophe which gripped the
entire German nation. At the time of our fatherland's deepest humiliation,
Johannes Palm of Nuremberg, burgher, bookseller, uncompromising nationalist
and French hater, died there for the Germany which he loved so passionately
even in her misfortune. He had stubbornly refused to denounce his accomplices
who were in fact his superiors. In thus he resembled Leo Schlageter. And
like him, he was denounced to the French by a representative of his government
An Augsburg police chief won this unenviable fame, thus furnishing an example
for our modern German officials in Herr Severing's Reich.In this little town on the Inn, gilded by the rays of German
martyrdom, Bavarian by blood, technically Austrian, lived my parents in
the late eighties of the past century; my father a dutiful civil servants
my mother giving all her being to the household, and devoted above all to
us children in eternal, loving care Little remains in my memory of this
period, for after a few years my father had to leave the little border city
he had learned to love, moving down the Inn to take a new position in Passau,
that is, in Germany proper.In those days constant moving was the lot of an Austrian customs
official. A short time later, my father was sent to Linz, and there he was
finally pensioned. Yet, indeed, this was not to mean "res"' for
the old gentleman. In his younger days, as the son of a poor cottager, he
couldn't bear to stay at home. Before he was even thirteen, the little boy
laced his tiny knapsack and ran away from his home in the Waldviertel. Despite
the at tempts of 'experienced' villagers to dissuade him, he made his way
to Vienna, there to learn a trade. This was in the fifties of the past century.
A desperate decision, to take to the road with only three gulden for travel
money, and plunge into the unknown. By the time the thirteen-year-old grew
to be seventeen, he had passed his apprentice's examination, but he was
not yet content. On the contrary. The long period of hardship, endless misery,
and suffering he had gone through strengthened his determination to give
up his trade and become ' something better. Formerly the poor boy had regarded
the priest as the embodiment of all humanly attainable heights; now in the
big city, which had so greatly widened his perspective, it was the rank
of civil servant. With all the tenacity of a young man whom suffering and
care had made 'old' while still half a child, the seventeen-year-old clung
to his new decision-he did enter the civil service. And after nearly twenty-three
years, I believe, he reached his goal. Thus he seemed to have fulfilled
a vow which he had made as a poor boy: that he would not return to his beloved
native village until he had made something of himself.His goal was achieved; but no one in the village could remember
the little boy of former days, and to him the village had grown strange.When finally, at the age of fifty-six, he went into retirement,
he could not bear to spend a single day of his leisure in idleness. Near
the Upper Austrian market village of Lambach he bought a farm, which he
worked himself, and thus, in the circuit of a long and industrious life,
returned to the origins of his forefathers.It was at this time that the first ideals took shape in my breast.
All my playing about in the open, the long walk to school, and particularly
my association with extremely 'husky' boys, which sometimes caused my mother
bitter anguish, made me the very opposite of a stay-at-home. And though
at that time I scarcely had any serious ideas as to the profession I should
one day pursue, my sympathies were in any case not in the direction of my
father's career. I believe that even then my oratorical talent was being
developed in the form of more or less violent arguments with my schoolmates.
I had become a little ringleader; at school I learned easily and at that
time very well, but was otherwise rather hard to handle. Since in my free
time I received singing lessons in the cloister at Lambach, I had excellent
opportunity to intoxicate myself with the solemn splendor of the brilliant
church festivals. As was only natural the abbot seemed to me, as the village
priest had once seemed to my father, the highest and most desirable ideal.
For a time, at least, this was the case. But since my father, for understandable
reasons, proved unable to appreciate the oratorical talents of his pugnacious
boy, or to draw from them any favorable conclusions regarding the future
of his offspring, he could, it goes without saying, achieve no understanding
for such youthful ideas. With concern he observed this conflict of nature.As it happened, my temporary aspiration for this profession
was in any case soon to vanish, making place for hopes more stated to my
temperament. Rummaging through my father's library, I had come across various
books of a military nature among them a popular edition of the Franco-German
War of 1870-7I It consisted of two issues of an illustrated periodical from
those years, which now became my favorite reading matter It was not long
before the great heroic struggle had become my greatest inner experience.
From then on I became more and more enthusiastic about everything that was
in any way connected with war or, for that matter, with soldieringBut in another respect as well, this was to assume importance
for me. For the first time, though as yet in a confused form, the question
was forced upon my consciousness: Was there a difference -and if so what
difference-between the Germans who fought these battles and other Germans?
Why hadn't Austria taken part in this war; why hadn't my father and all
the others fought?Are we not the same as all other Germans?Do we not all belong together? This problem began to gnaw at
my little brain for the first time. I asked cautious questions and with
secret envy received the answer that not every German was fortunate enough
to belong to Bismarck's Reich..This was more than I could understand.It was decided that I should go to high school.From my whole nature, and to an even greater degree from my
temperament, my father believed he could draw the inference that the humanistic
Gymnasium would represent a conflict with my talents. A Realschol seemed
to him more suitable. In this opinion he was especially strengthened by
my obvious aptitude for drawing; a subject which in his opinion was neglected
in the Austrian Gymnasiums. Another factor may have been his own laborious
career which made humanistic study seem impractical in his eyes, and therefore
less desirable. It was hus basic opinion and intention that, like himself,
his son would and must become a civil servant. It was only natural that
the hardships of his youth should enhance his subsequent achievement in
his eyes, particularly since it resulted exclusively from his own energy
and iron diligence. It was the pride of the self-made man which made him
want his son to rise to the same position in life, orJ of course, even higher
if possible, especially since, by his own industrious life, he thought he
would be able to facilitate his child's development so greatly.It was simply inconceivable to him that I might reject what
had become the content of his whole life. Consequently, my father s decision
was simple, definite, and clear; in his own eyes I mean, of course. Finally,
a whole lifetime spent in the bitter struggle for existence had given him
a domineering nature, and it would have seemed intolerable to him to leave
the final decision in such matters to an inexperienced boy, having as yet
no Sense of responsibility. Moreover, this would have seemed a sinful and
reprehensible weakness in the exercise of his proper parental authority
and responsibility for the future life of his child, and as such, absolutely
incompatible with his concept of duty.And yet things were to turn out differently.Then barely eleven years old, I was forced into opposition for
the first time in my life. Hard and determined as my father might be in
putting through plans and purposes once conceived his son was just as persistent
and recalcitrant in rejecting an idea which appealed to him not at all,
or in any case very little. I did not want to become a civil servant.Neither persuasion nor 'serious' arguments made any impression
on my resistance. I did not want to be a civil servant no, and again no.
All attempts on my father's part to inspire me with love or pleasure in
this profession by stories from his own life accomplished the exact opposite.
I yawned and grew sick to my stomach at the thought of sitting in an office,
deprived of my liberty; ceasing to be master of my own time and being compelled
to force the content of a whole life into blanks that had to be filled out.And what thoughts could this prospect arouse in a boy who in
reality was really anything but 'good' in the usual sense of the word?
School work was ridiculously easy, leaving me so much free time that the
sun saw more of me than my room. When today my political opponents direct
their loving attention to the examination of my life, following it back
to those childhood days and discover at last to their relief what intolerable
pranks this "Hitler" played even in his youth, I thank Heaven
that a portion of the memories of those happy days still remains with me.
Woods and meadows were then the battlefields on which the 'conflicts' which
exist everywhere in life were decided.In this respect my attendance at the Realschule, which now commenced,
made little difference.
But now, to be sure, there was a new conflict to be fought out.As long as my fathers intention of making me a civil servant
encountered only my theoretical distaste for the profession, the conflict
was bearable. Thus far, I had to some extent been able to keep my private
opinions to myself; I did not always have to contradict him immediately.
My own firm determination never to become a civil servant sufficed to give
me complete inner peace. And this decision in me was immutable. The problem
became more difficult when I developed a plan of my own in opposition to
my father's. And this occurred at the early age of twelve. How it happened,
I myself do not know, but one day it became clear to me that I would become
a painter, an artist. There was no doubt as to my talent for drawing; it
had been one of my father's reasons for sending me to the Realschule, but
never in all the world would it have occurred to him to give me professional
training in this direction. On the contrary. When for the first time, after
once again rejecting my father's favorite notion, I was asked what I myself
wanted to be, and I rather abruptly blurted out the decision I had meanwhile
made, my father for the moment was struck speechless.' Painter? Artist? 'He doubted my sanity, or perhaps he thought he had heard wrong
or misunderstood me. But when he was clear on the subject, and particularly
after he felt-the seriousness of my intention, he opposed it with all the
determination of his nature. His decision was extremely simple, for any
consideration of w at abilities I might really have was simply out of the
question.'Artist, no, never as long as I live!' But since his son, among
various other qualities, had apparently inherited his father' s stubbornness,
the same answer came back at him. Except, of course, that it was in the
opposite sense.And thus the situation remained on both sides. My father did
not depart from his 'Never!' And I intensified my 'Oh, yes!'The consequences, indeed, were none too pleasant. The old man
grew embittered, and, much as I loved him, so did I. Ally father forbade
me to nourish the slightest hope of ever being allowed to study art. I went
one step further and declared that if that was the case I would stop studying
altogether. As a result of such 'pronouncements,' of course, I drew the
short end; the old man began the relentless enforcement of his authority.
In the future, therefore, I was silent, but transformed my threat into reality.
I thought that once my father saw how little progress I was making at the
Realschule, he would let me devote myself to my dream, whether he liked
it or not.I do not know whether this calculation was correct. For the
moment only one thing was certain: my obvious lack of success at school.
What gave me pleasure I learned, especially everything which, in my opinion,
I should later need as a painter. What seemed to me unimportant in this
respect or was otherwise unattractive to me, I sabotaged completely. My
report cards at this time, depending on the subject and my estimation of
it, showed nothing but extremes. Side by side with 'laudable' and 'excellent,'
stood 'adequate' or even 'inadequate.' By far my best accomplishments were
in geography and even more so in history. These were my favorite subjects,
in which I led the; class.If now, after so many years, I examine the results of this period,
I regard two outstanding facts as particularly significant:First: I became a nationalistSecond: I learned to understand and grasp the meaning of history.Old Austria was a 'state of nationalities.'By and large, a subject of the German Reich, at that time at
least, was absolutely unable to grasp the significance of this fact for
the life of the individual in such a state. After the great victorious campaign
of the heroic armies in the Franco-German War, people had gradually lost
interest in the Germans living abroad; some could not, while others were
unable to appreciate their importances Especially with regard to the GermanAustrians,
the degenerate dynasty was only too frequently confused with the people,
which at the core was robust and healthy.What they failed to appreciate was that, unless the German in
Austria had really been of the best blood, he would never have had the power
to set his stamp on a nation of fifty-two million souls to such a degree
that, even in Germany, the erroneous opinion could arise that Austria was
a German state. This was an absurdity fraught with the direst consequences,
and yet a glowing testimonial to the ten million Germans in the Ostmark.
Only a handful of Germans in the Reich had the slightest conception of the
eternal and merciless struggle for the German language, German schools,
and a German way of life. Only today, when the same deplorable misery is
forced on many millions of Germans from the Reich, who under foreign rule
dream of their common fatherland and strive, amid their longing, at least
to preserve their holy right to their mother tongue, do wider circles understand
what it means to be forced to fight for one's nationality. Today perhaps
some can appreciate the greatness of the Germans in the Reich's old Ostmark,
who, with no one but themselves to depend on, for centuries protected the
Reich against incursions from the East, and finally carried on an exhausting
guerrilla warfare to maintain the German language frontier, at a time when
the Reich was highly interested in colonies, but not in its own flesh and
blood at its very doorstep.As everywhere and always, in every struggle, there were, in
this fight for the language in old Austria, three strata:The fighters, the lukewarm and the traitors.This sifting process began at school. For the remarkable fact
about the language struggle is that its waves strike hardest perhaps in
the school, since it is the seed-bed of the coming generation. It is a struggle
for the soul of the child, and to the child its first appeal is addressed:'German boy, do not forget you are a German,' and, 'Little girl,
remember that you are to become a German mother.'Anyone who knows the soul of youth will be able to understand
that it is they who lend ear most joyfully to such a battle-cry. They carry
on this struggle in hundreds of forms, in their own way and with their own
weapons. They refuse to sing unGerman songs. The more anyone tries to alienate
them from German heroic grandeur, the wilder becomes their enthusiasm: they
go hungry to save pennies for the grown-ups' battle fund their ears are
amazingly sensitive to un-German teachers, and at the same time they are
incredibly resistant; they wear the forbidden insignia of their own nationality
and are happy to be punished or even beaten for it. Thus, on a small scale
they are a faithful reflection of the adults, except that often their convictions
are better and more honest.I, too, while still comparatively young, had an opportunity
to take part in the struggle of nationalities in old Austria. Collections
were taken for the Sudmark I and the school association; we emphasized our
convictions by wearing corn-flowers and red lack, and gold colors; 'Heil
' was our greeting, and instead of the imperial anthem we sang 'Deutschland
uber Alles,' despite warnings and punishments. In this way the child received
political training in a period when as a rule the subject of a so-called
national state knew little more of his nationality than its language. It
goes without saying that even then I was not among the lukewarm. In a short
time I had become a fanatical 'German Nationalist,' though the term was
not identical with our present party concept.This development in me made rapid progress; by the time I was
fifteen I understood the difference between dynastic ' patriotism' and folkish
"nationalism'; and even then I was interested only in the latter.For anyone who has never taken the trouble to study the inner
conditions of the Habsburg monarchy, such a process may not be entirely
understandable. In this country the instruction in world history had to
provide the germ for this development, since to all intents and purposes
there is no such thing as a specifically Austrian history. The destiny of
this state is so much bound up with the life and development of all the
Germans that a separation of history into German and Austrian does not seem
conceivable. Indeed, when at length Germany began to divide into two spheres
of power, this division itself became German history.The insignia of former imperial glory, preserved in Vienna,
still seem to cast a magic spell; they stand as a pledge that these twofold
destinies are eternally one.The elemental cry of the German-Austrian people for union with
the German mother country, that arose in the days when the Habsburg state
was collapsing, was the result of a longing that slumbered in the heart
of the entire people-a longing to return to the never-forgotten ancestral
home. But this would be in explicable if the historical education of the
individual GermanAustrian had not given rise to so general a longing. In
it lies a well which never grows dry; which, especially in times of forgetfulness,
transcends all momentary prosperity and by constant reminders of the past
whispers softly of a new futureInstruction in world history in the so-called high schools is
even today in a very sorry condition. Few teachers understand that the aim
of studying history can never be to learn historical dates and events by
heart and recite them by rote; that what matters is not whether the child
knows exactly when this or that battle was fought, when a general was born,
or even when a monarch (usually a very insignificant one) came into the
crown of his forefathers. No, by the living God, this is very unimportant.To 'learn' history means to seek and find the forces which are
the causes leading to those effects which we subsequently perceive as historical
events.The art of reading as of learning is this: to retain the essential
to forget the non-essential.Perhaps it affected my whole later life that good fortune sent
me a history teacher who was one of the few to observe this principle in
teaching and examining. Dr. Leopold Potsch, my professor at the Realschule
in Linz, embodied this requirement to an ideal degree. This old gentleman's
manner was as kind as it was determined, his dazzling eloquence not only
held us spellbound but actually carried us away. Even today I think back
with gentle emotion on this gray-haired man who, by the fire of his narratives,
sometimes made us forget the present; who, as if by enchantment, carried
us into past times and, out of the millennial veils of mist, molded dry
historical memories into living reality. On such occasions we sat there,
often aflame with enthusiasm, and sometimes even moved to tears.What made our good fortune all the greater was that this teacher
knew how to illuminate the past by examples from the present, and how from
the past to draw inferences for the present. As a result he had more understanding
than anyone else for all the daily problems which then held us breathless.
He used our budding nationalistic fanaticism as a means of educating use
frequently appealing to our sense of national honor. By this alone he was
able to discipline us little ruffians more easily than would have been possible
by any other means.This teacher made history my favorite subject.And indeed, though he had no such intention, it was then that
I became a little revolutionary.For who could have studied German history under such a teacher
without becoming an enemy of the state which, through its ruling house,
exerted so disastrous an influence on the destinies of the nation?And who could retain his loyalty to a dynasty which in past
and present betrayed the needs of the German people again and again for
shameless private advantage?Did we not know, even as little boys, that this Austrian state
had and could have no love for us Germans?Our historical knowledge of the works of the House of Habsburg
was reinforced by our daily experience. In the north and south the poison
of foreign nations gnawed at the body of our nationality, and even Vienna
was visibly becoming more and more of an un-German city. The Royal House
Czechized wherever possible, and it was the hand of the goddess of eternal
justice and inexorable retribution which caused Archduke Francis Ferdinand,
the most mortal enemy of Austrian-Germanism, to fall by the bullets which
he himself had helped to mold. For had he not been the patron of Austria's
Slavization from above !Immense were the burdens which the German people were expected
to bear, inconceivable their sacrifices in taxes and blood, and yet anyone
who was not totally blind was bound to recognize that all this would be
in vain. What pained us most was the fact that this entire system was morally
whitewashed by the alliance with Germany, with the result that the slow
extermination of Germanism in the old monarchy was in a certain sense sanctioned
by Germany itself. The Habsburg hypocrisy, which enabled the Austrian rulers
to create the outward appearance that Austria was a German state, raised
the hatred toward this house to flaming indignation and at the same time
-contempt.Only in the Reich itself, the men who even then were called
to power saw nothing of all this. As though stricken with blindness, they
lived by the side of a corpse, and in the symptoms of rotten-
ness saw only the signs of 'new' life.The unholy alliance of the young Reich and the Austrian sham
state contained the germ of the subsequent World War and of the collapse
as well.In the course of this book I shall have occasion to take up
this problem at length. Here it suffices to state that even in my earliest
youth I came to the basic insight which never left me, but Only became more
profound:That Germanism could be safeguarded only by the destruction
of Austria, and, furthermore, that national sentiment is in no sense Identical
with dynastic patriotism; that above all the House of Habsburg was destined
to be the misfortune of the German nation.Even then I had drawn the consequences from this realization
ardent love for my German-Austrian homeland state.The habit of historical thinking which I thus learned in
school has never left me in the intervening years. To an ever-increasing
extent world history became for me an inexhaustible source of understanding
for the historical events of the present, in other words, for politics.
I do not want to 'learn' it, I want it to in instruct me.Thus, at an early age, I had become a political ' revolutionary,'
and I became an artistic revolutionary at an equally early age.The provincial capital of Upper Austria had at that time a theater
which was, relatively speaking, not bad. Pretty much of everything was produced.
At the age of twelve I saw Wilhelm Tell for the first time, and a few months
later my first opera, Lohengrin. I was captivated at once. My youthful enthusiasm
for the master of Bayreuth knew no bounds. Again and again I was drawn to
his works, and it still seems to me especially fortunate that the modest
provincial performance left me open to an intensified experience later on.All this, particularly after I had outgrown my adolescence (which
in my case was an especially painful process), reinforced my profound distaste
for the profession which my father had chosen for me. My conviction grew
stronger and stronger that I would never be happy as a civil servant. The
fact that by this time my gift for drawing had been recognized at the Realschule
made my determination all the firmer.Neither pleas nor threats could change it one bit.I wanted to become a painter and no power in the world could
make me a civil servant.Yet, strange as it may seem, with the passing years I became
more and more interested in architecture.At that time I regarded this as a natural complement to my gift
as a painter, and only rejoiced inwardly at the extension of my artistic
scope.I did not suspect that things would turn out differently.The question of my profession was to be decided more quickly
than I had previously expected.
In my thirteenth year I suddenly lost my father. A stroke of apoplexy felled
the old gentleman who was otherwise so hale, thus painlessly ending his
earthly pilgrimage, plunging us all into the depths of grief His most ardent
desire had been to help his son forge his career, thus preserving him from
his own bitter experience. In this, to all appearances, he had not succeeded.
But, though unwittingly, he had sown the seed for a future which at that
time neither he nor I would have comprehended.For the moment there was no outward change.My mother, to be sure, felt obliged to continue my education
in accordance with my father's wish; in other words, to have me study for
the civil servant's career. I, for my part, was more than ever determined
absolutely not to undertake this career. In proportion as my schooling departed
from my ideal in subject matter and curriculum, I became more indifferent
at heart. Then suddenly an illness came to my help and in a few weeks decided
my future and the eternal domestic quarrel. As a result of my serious lung
ailment, a physician advised my mother in most urgent terms never to send
me into an office. My attendance at the Realschule had furthermore to be
interrupted for at least a year. The goal for which I had so long silently
yearned, for which I had always fought, had through this event suddenly
become reality almost of its own accord.Concerned over my illness, my mother finally consented to take
me out of the Realschule and let- me attend the Academy.These were the happiest days of my life and seemed to me almost
a dream; and a mere dream it was to remain. Two years later, the death of
my mother put a sudden end to all my highflown plans.It was the conclusion of a long and painful illness which from
the beginning left little hope of recovery. Yet it was a dreadful blow,
particularly for me. I had honored my father, but my mother I had loved.Poverty and hard reality now compelled me to take a quick decision.
What little my father had left had been largely exhausted by my mother's
grave illness; the orphan's pension to which I was entitled was not enough
for me even to live on, and so I was faced with the problem of somehow making
my own living.In my hand a suitcase full of clothes and underwear; in my heart
an indomitable will, I journeyed to Vienna. I, too, hoped to wrest from
Fate what my father had accomplished fifty years before; I, too, wanted
to become 'something'-but on no account a civil servant.


WHEN my mother died, Fate, at least in one respect, had made
its decisions. In the last months of her sickness, I had gone to Vienna to
take the entrance examination for the Academy. I had set out with a pile
of drawings, convinced that it would be child's play to pass the examination.
At the Realschule I had been by far the best in my class at drawing,
and since then my ability had developed amazingly; my own satisfaction caused
me to take a joyful pride in hoping for the best.Yet sometimes a drop of bitterness put in its appearance: my
talent for painting seemed to be excelled by my talent for drawing, especially
in almost all fields of architecture. At the same time my interest in architecture
as such increased steadily, and this development was accelerated after a
two weeks' trip to Vienna which I took when not yet sixteen. The purpose
of my trip was to study the picture gallery in the Court Museum, but I had
eyes for scarcely anything but the Museum itself. From morning until late
at night, I ran from one object of interest to another, but it was always
the buildings which held my primary interest. For hours I could stand in
front of the Opera, for hours I could gaze at the Parliament; the whole
Ring Boulevard seemed to me like an enchantment out of -The Thousand-and-One-Nights.Now I was in the fair city for the second time, waiting with
burning impatience, but also with confident self-assurance, for the result
of my entrance examination. I was so convinced that I would be successful
that when I received my rejection, it struck me as a bolt from the blue.
Yet that is what happened. When I presented myself to the rector, requesting
an explanation for my non-acceptance at the Academy's school of painting,
that gentleman assured me that the drawings I had submitted incontrovertibly
showed my unfitness for painting, and that my ability obviously lay in the
field of architecture; for me, he said, the Academy's school of painting
was out of the question, the place for me was the School of Architecture.
It was incomprehensible to him that I had never attended an architectural
school or received any other training in architecture. Downcast, I left
von Hansen's magnificent building on the Schillerplatz, for the first time
in my young life at odds with myself. For what I had just heard about my
abilities seemed like a lightning flash, suddenly revealing a conflict with
which I had long been afflicted, although until then I had no clear conception
of its why and wherefore.In a few days I myself knew that I should some day become an
architect. To be sure, it was an incredibly hard road; for the studies
I had neglected out of spite at the Realschule were sorely needed.
One could not attend the Academy's architectural school without having attended
the building school at the Technic, and the latter required a high-school
degree. I had none of all this. The fulfill- ment of my artistic dream seemed
physically impossible.When after the death of my mother I went to Vienna for the third
time, to remain for many years, the time which had mean-while elapsed had
restored my calm and determination. My old defiance had come back to me
and my goal was now clear and definite before my eyes. I wanted to become
an architect, and obstacles do not exist to be surrendered to, but only
to be broken. I was determined to overcome these obstacles, keeping before
my eyes the image of my father, who had started out as the child of a village
shoemaker, and risen by his own efforts to be a government official. I had
a better foundation to build on, and hence my possibilities in the struggle
were easier, and what then seemed to be the harshness of Fate, I praise
today as wisdom and Providence. While the Goddess of Suffering took me in
her arms, often threatening to crush me, my will to resistance grew, and
in the end this will was victorious.I owe it to that period that I grew hard and am still capable
of being hard. And even more, I exalt it for tearing me away from the hollowness
of comfortable life; for drawing the mother's darling out of his soft downy
bed and giving him 'Dame Care' for a new mother; for hurling me, despite
all resistance, into a world of misery and poverty, thus making me acquainted
with those for whom I was later to fight.In this period my eyes were opened to two menaces of which
I had previously scarcely known the names, and whose terrible importance
for the existence of the German people I certainly did not understand: Marxism
and Jewry.To me Vienna, the city which, to so many, is the epitome of
innocent pleasure, a festive playground for merrymakers, represents, I am
sorry to say, merely the living memory of the saddest period of my life.Even today this city can arouse in me nothing but the most dismal
thoughts. For me the name of this Phaeacian city I represents five years
of hardship and misery. Five years in which I was forced to earn a living,
first as a day laborer, then as a small painter; a truly meager living which
never sufficed to appease even my daily hunger. Hunger was then my faithful
bodyguard; he never left me for a moment and partook of all I had, share
and share alike. Every book I acquired aroused his interest; a visit to
the Opera prompted his attentions for days at a time; my life was a continuous
struggle with this pitiless friend. And yet during this time I studied as
never before. Aside from my architecture and my rare visits to the Opera,
paid-for in hunger, I had but one pleasure: my books.At that time I read enormously and thoroughly. All the free
time my work left me was employed in my studies. In this way I forged in
a few years' time the foundations of a knowledge from which I still draw
nourishment today.And even more than this:In this period there took shape within me a world picture and
a philosophy which became the granite foundation of all my acts. In addition
to what I then created, I have had to learn little; and I have had to alter
nothing.On the contrary.Today I am firmly convinced that basically and on the whole
all creative ideas appear in our youth, in so far as any such are present.
I distinguish between the wisdom of age, consisting solely in greater thoroughness
and caution due to the experience of a long life, and the genius of youth,
which pours out thoughts and ideas with inexhaustible fertility, but cannot
for the moment develop them because of their very abundance. It is this
youthful genius which provides the building materials and plans for the
future, from which a wiser age takes the stones, carves them and completes
the edifice, in so far as the so-called wisdom of age has not stifled the
genius of youth.The life which I had hitherto led at home differed little
or not at all from the life of other people. Carefree, I could await the
new day, and there was no social problem for me. The environment of my youth
consisted of petty-bourgeois circles, hence of a world having very little
relation to the purely manual worker. For, strange as it may seem at first
glance, the cleft between this class, which in an economic sense is by no
means so brilliantly situated, and the manual worker is often deeper than
we imagine. The reason for this hostility, as we might almost call it, lies
in the fear of a social group, which has but recently raised itself above
the level of the manual worker, that it will sink back into the old despised
class, or at least become identified with it. To this, in many cases, we
must add the repugnant memory of the cultural poverty of this lower class,
the frequent vulgarity of its social intercourse; the petty bourgeois' own
position in society, however insignificant it may be, makes any contact
with this outgrown stage of life and culture intolerable.Consequently, the higher classes feel less constraint in their
dealings with the lowest of their fellow men than seems possible to the
'upstart.'For anyone is an upstart who rises by his own efforts from his
previous position in life to a higher one.Ultimately this struggle, which is often so hard, kills all
pity. Our own painful struggle for existence destroys our feeling for the
misery of those who have remained behind.In this respect Fate was kind to me. By forcing me to return
to this world of poverty and insecurity, from which my father had risen
in the course of his life, it removed the blinders of a narrow petty-bourgeois
upbringing from my eyes. Only now did I learn to know humanity, learning
to distinguish between empty appearances or brutal externals and the inner
being.After the turn of the century, Vienna was, socially speaking,
one of the most backward cities in Europe.Dazzling riches and loathsome poverty alternated sharply. In
the center and in the inner districts you could really feel the pulse of
this realm of fifty-two millions, with all the dubious magic of the national
melting pot. The Court with its dazzling glamour attracted wealth and intelligence
from the rest of the country like a magnet. Added to this was the strong
centralization of the Habsburg monarchy in itself.It offered the sole possibility of holding this medley of nations
together in any set form. But the consequence was an extraordinary concentration
of high authorities in the imperial capitalYet not only in the political and intellectual sense was Vienna
the center of the old Danube monarchy, but economically as well. The host
of high of officers, government officials, artists, and scholars was confronted
by an even greater army of workers, and side by side with aristocratic and
commercial wealth dwelt dire poverty. Outside the palaces on the Ring loitered
thousands of unemployed, and beneath this Via Triumphalis of old Austria
dwelt the homeless in the gloom and mud of the canals.In hardly any German city could the social question have been
studied better than in Vienna. But make no mistake. This 'studying' cannot
be done from lofty heights. No one who has not been seized in the jaws of
this murderous viper can know its poison fangs. Otherwise nothing results
but superficial chatter and false sentimentality. Both are harmful. The
former because it can never penetrate to the core of the problem, the latter
because it passes it by. I do not know which is more terrible: inattention
to social misery such as we see every day among the majority of those who
have been favored by fortune or who have risen by their own efforts, or
else the snobbish, or at times tactless and obtrusive, condescension of
certain women of fashion in skirts or in trousers, who ' feel for the people.'
In any event, these gentry sin far more than their minds, devoid of all
instinct, are capable of realizing. Consequently, and much to their own
amazement, the result of their social 'efforts' is always nil, frequently,
in fact, an indignant rebuff, though this, of course, is passed off as a
proof of the people's ingratitude.Such minds are most reluctant to realize that social endeavor
has nothing in common with this sort of thing; that above all it can raise
no claim to gratitude, since its function is not to distribute favors but
to restore rights.I was preserved from studying the social question in such a
way. By drawing me within its sphere of suffering, it did not seem to invite
me to 'study,' but to experience it in my own skin. It was none of its doing
that the guinea pig came through the operation safe and sound.An attempt to enumerate the sentiments I experienced in that
period could never be even approximately complete; I shall describe here
only the most essential impressions, those which often moved me most deeply,
and the few lessons which I derived from them at the time.The actual business of finding work was, as a rule, not hard
for me, since I was not a skilled craftsman, but was obliged to seek my
daily bread as a so-called helper and sometimes as a casual laborer.
I adopted the attitude of all those who shake the dust of Europe from their
feet with the irrevocable intention of founding a new existence in the New
World and conquering a new home. Released from all the old, paralyzing ideas
of profession and position, environment and tradition, they snatch at every
livelihood that offers itself, grasp at every sort of work, progressing
step by step to the realization that honest labor, no matter of what sort,
disgraces no one. I, too, was determined to leap into this new world, with
both feet, and fight my way through.
I soon learned that there was always some kind of work to be had, but equally
soon I found out how easy it was to lose it.
The uncertainty of earning my daily bread soon seemed to me one of the darkest
sides of my new life.The ' skilled' worker does not find himself out on the street
as frequently as the unskilled; but he is not entirely immune to this fate
either. And in his case the loss of livelihood owing to lack of work is
replaced by the lock-out, or by going on strike himself.
In this respect the entire economy suffers bitterly from the individual's
insecurity in earning his daily bread.The peasant boy who goes to the big city, attracted by the easier
nature of the work (real or imaginary), by shorter hours, but most of all
by the dazzling light emanating from the metropolis, is accustomed to a
certain security in the matter of livelihood. He leaves his old job only
when there is at least some prospect of a new one. For there is a great
lack of agricultural workers, hence the probability of any long period of
unemployment is in itself small. It is a mistake to believe that the young
fellow who goes to the big city is made of poorer stuff than his brother
who continues to make an honest living from the peasant sod. No, on the
contrary: experience shows that all those elements which emigrate consist
of the healthiest and most energetic natures, rather than conversely. Yet
among these 'emigrants' we must count, not only those who go to America,
but to an equal degree the young farmhand who resolves to leave his native
village for the strange city. He, too, is prepared to face an uncertain
fate. As a rule he arrives in the big city with a certain amount of money;
he has no need to lose heart on the very first day if he has the ill fortune
to find no work for any length of time. But it is worse if, after finding
a job, he soon loses it. To find a new one, especially in winter, is often
difficult if not impossible. Even so, the first weeks are tolerable. He
receives an unemployment benefit from his union funds and manages as well
as possible. But when his last cent is gone and the union, due to the long
duration of his unemployment, discontinues its payments, great hardships
begin. Now he walks the streets, hungry; often he pawns and sells his last
possessions; his clothing becomes more and more wretched; and thus he sinks
into external surroundings which, on top of his physical misfortune, also
poison his soul. If he is evicted and if (as is so often the case) this
occurs in winter, his misery is very great. At length he finds some sort
of job again. But the old story is repeated. The same thing happens a second
time, the third time perhaps it is even worse, and little by little he learns
to bear the eternal insecurity with greater and greater indifference. At
last the repetition becomes a habit.And so this man, who was formerly so hard-working, grows lax
in his whole view of life and gradually becomes the instrument of those
who use him only for their own base advantage. He has so often been unemployed
through no fault of his own that one time more or less ceases to matter,
even when the aim is no longer to fight for economic rights, but to destroy
political, social, or culturaL values in general. He may not be exactly
enthusiastic about strikes, but at any rate he has become indifferent.With open eyes I was able to follow this process in a thousand
examples. The more I witnessed it, the greater grew my revulsion for the
big city which first avidly sucked men in and then so cruelly crushed them.When they arrived, they belonged to their people; after remaining
for a few years, they were lost to it.I, too, had been tossed around by life in the metropolis- in
my own skin I could feel the effects of this fate and taste them with my
soul. One more thing I saw: the rapid change from work to unemployment and
vice versa, plus the resultant fluctuation of income, end by destroying
in many all feeling for thrift, or any understanding for a prudent ordering
of their lives. It would seem that the body gradually becomes accustomed
to living on the fat of the land in good times and going hungry in bad times.
Indeed, hunger destroys any resolution for reasonable budgeting in better
times to come by holding up to the eyes of its tormented victim an eternal
mirage of good living and raising this dream to such a pitch of longing
that a pathological desire puts an end to all restraint as soon as wages
and earnings make it at all possible. The consequence is that once the man
obtains work he irresponsibly forgets all ideas of order and discipline,
and begins to live luxuriously for the pleasures of the moment. This upsets
even the small weekly budget, as even here any intelligent apportionment
is lacking; in the beginning it suffices for five days instead of seven,
later only for three, finally scarcely for one day, and in the end it is
drunk up in the very first night.
Often he has a wife and children at home. Sometimes they, too, are infected
by this life, especially when the man is good to them on the whole and actually
loves them in his own way. Then the weekly wage is used up by the whole
family in two or three days; they eat and drink as long as the money holds
out and the last days they go hungry. Then the wife drags herself out into
the neighborhood, borrows a little, runs up little debts at the food store,
and in this way strives to get through the hard last days of the week. At
noon they all sit together before their meager and sometimes empty bowls,
waiting for the next payday, speaking of it, making plans, and, in their
hunger, dreaming of the happiness to come.And so the little children, in their earliest beginnings, are
made familiar with this misery.It ends badly if the man goes his own way from the very beginning
and the woman, for the children's sake, opposes him. Then there is fighting
and quarreling, and, as the man grows estranged from his wife, he becomes
more intimate with alcohol. He is drunk every Saturday, and, with her instinct
of selfpreservation for herself and her children, the woman has to fight
to get even a few pennies out of him; and, to make matters worse, this usually
occurs on his way from the factory to the barroom. When at length he comes
home on Sunday or even Monday night, drunk and brutal, but always parted
from his last cent, such scenes often occur that God have mercy!I have seen this in hundreds of instances. At first I was repelled
or even outraged, but later I understood the whole tragedy of this misery
and its deeper causes. These people are the unfortunate victims of bad conditions!
Even more dismal in those days were the housing conditions. The misery in
which the Viennese day laborer lived was frightful to behold. Even today
it fills me with horror when I think of these wretched caverns, the lodging
houses and tenements, sordid scenes of garbage, repulsive filth, and worse.What was-and still is-bound to happen some day, when the stream
of unleashed slaves pours forth from these miserable dens to avenge themselves
on their thoughtless fellow men FFor thoughtless they are!Thoughtlessly they let things slide along, and with their utter
lack of intuition fail even to suspect that sooner or later Fate must bring
retribution, unless men conciliate Fate while there is still time.
How thankful I am today to the Providence which sent me to that school!
In it I could no longer sabotage the subjects I did not like. It educated
me quickly and thoroughly.If I did not wish to despair of the men who constituted my environment
at that time, I had to learn to distinguish between their external characters
and lives and the foundations of their development. Only then could all
this be borne without losing heart. Then, from all the misery and despair,
from all the filth and outward degeneration, it was no longer human beings
that emerged, but the deplorable results of deplorable laws; and the hardship
of my own life, no easier than the others, preserved me from capitulating
in tearful sentimentality to the degenerate products of this process of
development.No, this is not the way to understand all these things!Even then I saw that only a twofold road could lead to the goal
of improving these conditions:The deepest sense of social responsibility for the creation
of better foundations for our development, coupled with brutal determination
on breaking down incurable tenors.Just as Nature does not concentrate her greatest attention in
preserving what exists, but in breeding offspring to carry on the species,
likewise, in human life, it is less important artificially to alleviate
existing evil, which, in view of human nature, is ninety-nine per cent impossible,
than to ensure
from the start healthier channels for a future development.During my struggle for existence in Vienna, it had become clear
to me thatSocial activity must never and on no account be directed toward
philanthropic flim-flam, but rather toward the elimination of the basic
deficiencies in the organization of our economic and cultural life that
must-or at all events can-lead to the degeneration of the individual .The difficulty of applying the most extreme and brutal methods
against the criminals who endanger the state lies not least in the uncertainty
of our judgment of the inner motives or causes of such contemporary phenomena.This uncertainty is only too well founded in our own sense of
guilt regarding such tragedies of degeneration; be that as it may, it paralyzes
any serious and firm decision and is thus partly responsible for the weak
and half-hearted, because hesitant, execution of even the most necessary
measures of selfpreservation.Only when an epoch ceases to be haunted by the shadow of its
own consciousness of guilt will it achieve the inner calm and outward strength
brutally and ruthlessly to prune off the wild shoots and tear out the weeds.Since the Austrian state had practically no social legislation
or jurisprudence, its weakness in combating even malignant tumors was glaring.I do not know what horrified me most at that time: the economic misery
of my companions, their moral and ethical coarseness, or the low level of
their intellectual development.How often does our bourgeoisie rise in high moral indignation
when they hear some miserable tramp declare that it is all the same to him
whether he is a German or not, that he feels equally happy wherever he is,
as long as he has enough to live on!This lack of 'national pride' is most profoundly deplored, and
horror at such an attitude is expressed in no uncertain terms.How many people have asked themselves what was the real reason
for the superiority of their own sentiments?How many are aware of the infinite number of separate memories
of the greatness of our national fatherland in all the fields of cultural
and artistic life, whose total result is to inspire them with just pride
at being members of a nation so blessed?How many suspect to how great an extent pride in the fatherland
depends on knowledge of its greatness in all these fields?Do our bourgeois circles ever stop to consider to what an absurdly
small extent this prerequisite of pride in the fatherland is transmitted
to the 'people'?Let us not try to condone this by saying that ' it is no better
in other countries,' and that in those countries the worker avows his nationality
'notwithstanding.' Even if this were so, it could serve as no excuse for
our own omissions. But it is not so; for the thing that we constantly designate
as 'chauvinistic' education; for example among the French people, is nothing
other than extreme emphasis on the greatness of France in all the fields
of culture, or, as the Frenchman puts it, of 'civilization The fact is that
the young Frenchman is not brought up to be objective, but is instilled
with the most subjective conceivable view, in so far as the importance of
the political or cultural greatness of his fatherland is concerned.This education will always have to be limited to general and
extremely broad values which, if necessary, must be engraved in the memory
and feeling of the people by eternal repetition.But to the negative sin of omission is added in our country
the positive destruction of the little which the individual has the good
fortune to learn in school. The rats that politically poison our nation
gnaw even this little from the heart and memory of the broad masses, in
so far as this has not been previously accomplished by poverty and suffering.Imagine, for instance, the following scene:In a basement apartment, consisting of two stuffy rooms, dwells
a worker's family of seven. Among the five children there is a boy of, let
us assume, three years. This is the age in which the first impressions are
made on the consciousness of the child Talented persons retain traces of
memory from this period down to advanced old age. The very narrowness and
overcrowding of the room does not lead to favorable conditions. Quarreling
and wrangling will very frequently arise as a result. In these circumstances,
people do not live with one another, they press against one another. Every
argument, even the most trifling, which in a spacious apartment can be reconciled
by a mild segregation, thus solving itself, here leads to loathsome wrangling
without end. Among the children, of course, this is still bearable; they
always fight under such circumstances, and among themselves they quickly
and thoroughly forget about it. But if this battle is carried on between
the parents themselves, and almost every day in forms which for vulgarity
often leave nothing to be desired, then, if only very gradually, the results
of such visual instruction must ultimately become apparent in the children.
The character the) will inevitably assume if this mutual quarrel takes the
form of brutal attacks of the father against the mother, of drunken beatings,
is hard for anyone who does not know this milieu to imagine. At the age
of six the pitiable little boy suspects the existence of things which can
inspire even an adult with nothing but horror. Morally poisoned, physically
undernourished, his poor little head full of lice, the young 'citizen' goes
off to public school. After a great struggle he may learn to read and write,
but that is about all. His doing any homework is out of the question. On
the contrary, the very mother and father, even in the presence of the children,
talk about his teacher and school in terms which are not fit to be repeated,
and are more inclined to curse the latter to their face than to take their
little offspring across their knees and teach them some sense. All the other
things that the little fellow hears at home do not tend to increase his
respect for his dear fellow men. Nothing good remains of humanity, no institution
remains unassailed; beginning with his teacher and up to the head of the
government, whether it is a question of religion or of morality as such,
of the state or society, it is all the same, everything is reviled in the
most obscene terms and dragged into the filth of the basest possible outlook.
When at the age of fourteen the young man is discharged from school, it
is hard to decide what is stronger in him: his incredible stupidity as far
as
any real knowledge and ability are concerned, or the corrosive insolence
of his behavior, combined with an immorality, even at this age, which would
make your hair stand on endWhat position can this man-to whom even now hardly anything
is holy, who, just as he has encountered no greatness conversely suspects
and knows all the sordidness of life- occupy in the life into which he is
now preparing to emerge?The three-year-old child has become a fifteen-year-old despiser
of all authority. Thus far, aside from dirt and filth, this young man has
seen nothing which might inspire him to any higher enthusiasm.But only now does he enter the real university of this existence.Now he begins the same life which all along his childhood years
he has seen his father living. He hangs around the street corners and bars,
coming home God knows when; and for a change now and then he beats the broken-down
being which was once his mother, curses God and the world, and at length
is convicted of some particular offense and sent to a house of correction.There he receives his last polish.And his dear bourgeois fellow men are utterly amazed at the
lack of 'national enthusiasm' in this young 'citizen.'Day by day, in the theater and in the movies, in backstairs
literature and the yellow press, they see the poison poured into the people
by bucketfuls, and then they are amazed at the low 'moral content,' the
'national indifference,' of the masses of the people.As though trashy films, yellow press, and such-like dung could.
furnish the foundations of a knowledge of the greatness of our fatherland!-quite
aside from the early education of the individual.What I had never suspected before, I quickly and thoroughly
learned in those years:The question of the 'nationalization' of a people is, among
other things, primarily a question of creating healthy social conditions
as a foundation for the possibility of educating the individual. For only
those who through school and upbringing learn to know the cultural, economic,
but above all the political, greatness of their own fatherland can and unit
achieve the inner pride in the privilege of being a member of such a people.
And I can fight only for something that I love, love only what I respect,
and respect only what I at least know.Once my interest in the social question was aroused, I began
to study it with all thoroughness. It was a new and hitherto unknown world
which opened before me.In the years 1909 and 1910, my own situation had changed somewhat
in so far as I no longer had to earn my daily bread as a common laborer.
By this time I was working independently as a small draftsman and painter
of watercolors. Hard as this was with regard to earnings-it was barely enough
to live on- it was good for my chosen profession. Now I was no longer dead
tired in the evening when I came home from work, unable to look at a book
without soon dozing off. My present work ran parallel to my future profession.
Moreover, I was master of my own time and could apportion it better than
had previously been possible.I painted to make a living and studied for pleasure.Thus I was able to supplement my visual instruction in the social
problem by theoretical study. I studied more or less all of the books I
was able to obtain regarding this whole field, and for the rest immersed
myself in my own thoughts.I believe that those who knew me in those days took me for an
eccentric.Amid all this, as was only natural, I served my love of architecture
with ardent zeal. Along with music, it seemed to me the queen of the arts:
under such circumstances my concern with it was not 'work.' but the greatest
pleasure. I could read and draw until late into the night, and never grow
tired. Thus my faith grew that my beautiful dream for the future would become
reality after all, even though this might require long years. I was firmly
convinced that I should some day make a name for myself as an architect.In addition, I had the greatest interest in everything connected
with politics, but this did not seem to me very significant. On the contrary:
in my eyes this was the self-evident duty of every thinking man. Anyone
who failed to understand this lost the right to any criticism or complaint.In this field, too, I read and studied much.By 'reading,' to be sure, I mean perhaps something different
than the average member of our so-called 'intelligentsia.'I know people who 'read' enormously, book for book, letter for
letter, yet whom I would not describe as 'well-read.' True they possess
a mass of 'knowledge,' but their brain is unable to organize and register
the material they have taken in. They lack the art of sifting what is valuable
for them in a book from that which is without value, of retaining the one
forever, and, if possible, not even seeing the rest, but in any case not
dragging it around with them as useless ballast. For reading is no end in
itself, but a means to an end. It should primarily help to fill the framework
constituted by every man's talents and abilities; in addition, it should
provide the tools and building materials which the individual needs for
his life's work, regardless whether this consists in a primitive struggle
for sustenance or the satisfaction of a high calling; secondly, it should
transmit a general world view. In both cases, however, it is essential that
the con tent of what one reads at any time should not be transmitted to
the memory in the sequence of the book or books, but like the stone of a
mosaic should fit into the general world picture in its proper place, and
thus help to form this picture in the mind of the reader. Otherwise there
arises a confused muddle of memorized facts which not only are worthless,
but also make their unto fortunate possessor conceited. For such a reader
now believes himself in all seriousness to be {educated,' to understand
something of life, to have knowledge, while in reality, with every new acquisition
of this kind of 'education,' he is growing more and more removed from the
world until, not infrequently, he ends up in a sanitarium or in parliament.
Never will such a mind succeed in culling from the confusion of his ' knowledge
' anything that suits the demands of the hour, for his intellectual ballast
is not organized along the lines of life, but in the sequence of the books
as he read them and as their content has piled up in his brain If Fate,
in the requirements of his daily life, desired to remind him to make a correct
application of what he had read, it would have to indicate title and page
number, since the poor fool would otherwise never in all his life find the
correct place. But since Fate does not do this, these bright boys in any
critical situation come into the most terrible embarrassment, cast about
convulsively for analogous cases, and with mortal certainty naturally find
the wrong formulas.If this were not true, it would be impossible for us to understand
the political behavior of our learned and highly placed government heroes,
unless we decided to assume outright villainy instead of pathological propensities.On the other hand, a man who possesses the art of correct reading
will, in studying any book, magazine, or pamphlet, instinctively and immediately
perceive everything which in his opinion is worth permanently remembering,
either because it is suited to his purpose or generally worth knowing. Once
the knowledge he has achieved in this fashion is correctly coordinated within
the somehow existing picture of this or that subject created by the imaginations
it will function either as a corrective or a complement, thus enhancing
either the correctness or the clarity of the picture. Then, if life suddenly
sets some question before us for examination or answer, the memory, if this
method of reading is observed, will immediately take the existing picture
as a norm, and from it will derive all the individual items regarding these
questions, assembled in the course of decades, submit them to the mind for
examination and reconsideration, until the question is clarified or answered.Only this kind of reading has meaning and purpose.An orator, for example, who does not thus provide his intelligence
with the necessary foundation will never be in a position cogently to defend
his view in the face of opposition, though it may be a thousand times true
or real. In every discussion his memory will treacherously leave him in
the lurch; he will find neither grounds for reinforcing his own contentions
nor any for confuting those of his adversary. If, as in the case of a speaker,
it is only a question of making a fool of himself personally, it may not
be so bad, but not so when Fate predestines such a know-it-all incompetent
to be the leader of a state.Since my earliest youth I have endeavored to read in the correct
way, and in this endeavor I have been most happily supported by my memory
and intelligence. Viewed in this light, my Vienna period was especially
fertile and valuable. The experiences of daily life provided stimulation
for a constantly renewed study of the most varied problems. Thus at last
I was in a position to bolster up reality by theory and test theory by reality,
and was preserved from being stifled by theory or growing banal through
reality.In this period the experience of daily life directed and stimulated
me to the most thorough theoretical study of two questions in addition to
the social question.Who knows when I would have immersed myself in the doctrines
and essence of Marxism if that period had not literally thrust my nose into
the problem!What I knew of Social Democracy in my youth was exceedingly
little and very inaccurate.I was profoundly pleased that it should carry on the struggle
for universal suffrage and the secret ballot. For even then my intelligence
told me that this must help to weaken the Habsburg regime which I so hated.
In the conviction that the Austrian Empire could never be preserved except
by victimizing its Germans, but that even the price of a gradual Slavization
of the German element by no means provided a guaranty of an empire really
capable of survival, since the power of the Slavs to uphold the state must
be estimated as exceedingly dubious, I welcomed every development which
in my opinion would inevitably lead to the collapse of this impossible state
which condemned ten million Germans to death. The more the linguistic Babel
corroded and disorganized parliament, the closer drew the inevitable hour
of the disintegration of this Babylonian Empire, and with it the hour of
freedom for my German-Austrian people. Only in this way could the Anschluss
with the old mother country be restored.Consequently, this activity of the Social Democracy was not
displeasing to me. And the fact that it strove to improve the living conditions
of the worker, as, in my innocence, I was still stupid enough to believe,
likewise seemed to speak rather for it than against it. What most repelled
me was its hostile attitude toward the struggle for the preservation of
Germanism, its disgraceful courting of the Slavic 'comrade,' who accepted
this declaration of love in so far as it was bound up with practical concessions,
but otherwise maintained a lofty and arrogant reserve, thus giving the obtrusive
beggars their deserved reward.Thus, at the age of seventeen the word 'Marxism' was as yet
little known to me, while ' Social Democracy ' and socialism seemed to me
identical concepts. Here again it required the fist of Fate to open my eyes
to this unprecedented betrayal of the peoples.Up to that time I had known the Social Democratic Party only
as an onlooker at a few mass demonstrations, without possessing even the
slightest insight into the mentality of its adherents or the nature of its
doctrine; but now, at one stroke, I came into contact with the products
of its education and 'philosophy.' And in a few months I obtained what might
otherwise have required decades: an understanding of a pestilential whore,l
cloaking herself as social virtue and brotherly love, from which I hope
humanity will rid this earth with the greatest dispatch, since otherwise
the earth might well become rid of humanity.My first encounter with the Social Democrats occurred during
my employment as a building worker.From the very beginning it was none too pleasant. ;My clothing
was still more or less in order, my speech cultivated, and my manner reserved.
I was still so busy with my own destiny that I could not concern myself
much with the people around me. I looked for work only to avoid starvation,
only to obtain an opportunity of continuing my education, though ever so
slowly. Perhaps I would not have concerned myself at all with my new environment
if on the third or fourth day an event had not taken place which forced
me at once to take a position. I was asked to join the organization.My knowledge of trade-union organization was at that time practically
non-existent. I could not have proved that its existence was either beneficial
or harmful. When I was told that I had to join, I refused. The reason I
gave was that I did not understand the matter, but that I would not let
myself be forced into anything. Perhaps my first reason accounts for my
not being thrown out at once. They may perhaps have hoped to convert me
or break down my resistance in a few days. In any event, they had made a
big mistake. At the end of two weeks I could no longer have joined, even
if I had wanted to. In these two weeks I came to know the men around me
more closely, and no power in the world could have moved me to join an organization
whose members had meanwhile come to appear to me in so unfavorable a light.During the first days I was irritable.At noon some of the workers went to the near-by taverns while
others remained at the building site and ate a lunch which, as a rule was
quite wretched. These were the married men whose wives brought them their
noonday soup in pathetic bowls. Toward the end of the week their number
always increased, why I did not understand until later. On these occasions
politics was discussed.I drank my bottle of milk and ate my piece of bread somewhere
off to one side, and cautiously studied my new associates or reflected on
my miserable lot. Nevertheless, I heard more than enough; and often it seemed
to me that they purposely moved closer to me, perhaps in order to make me
take a position. In any case, what I heard was of such a nature as to infuriate
me in the extreme. These men rejected everything: the nation as an invention
of the ' capitalistic ' (how often was I forced to hear this single word!)
classes; the fatherland as an instrument of the bourgeoisie for the exploitation
of the working class; the authority of law as a means for oppressing the
proletariat; the school as an institution for breeding slaves and slaveholders;
religion as a means for stultifying the people and making them easier to
exploit; morality as a symptom of stupid, sheeplike patience, etc. There
was absolutely nothing which was not drawn through the mud of a terrifying
depthsAt first I tried to keep silent. But at length it became impossible.
I began to take a position and to oppose them. But I was forced to recognize
that this was utterly hopeless until I possessed certain definite knowledge
of the controversial points. And so I began to examine the sources from
which they drew this supposed wisdom. I studied book after book, pamphlet
after pamphlet.From then on our discussions at work were often very heated.
I argued back, from day to day better informed than my antagonists concerning
their own knowledge, until one day they made use of the weapon which most
readily conquers reason: terror and violence. A few of the spokesmen on
the opposing side forced me either to leave the building at once or be thrown
off the scaffolding. Since I was alone and resistance seemed hopeless, I
preferred, richer by one experience, to follow the former counsel.I went away filled with disgust, but at the same time so agitated
that it would have been utterly impossible for me to turn my back on the
whole business. No, after the first surge of indignation, my stubbornness
regained the upper hand. I was determined to go to work on another building
in spite of my experience. In this decision I was reinforced by Poverty
which, a few weeks later, after I had spent what little I had saved from
my wages. enfolded me in her heartless arms. I had to go back whether I
wanted to or not. The same old story began anew and ended very much the
same as the first time.I wrestled with my innermost soul: are these people human, worthy
to belong to a great nation?A painful question; for if it is answered in the affirmative,
the struggle for my nationality really ceases to be worth the hardships
and sacrifices which the best of us have to make for the sake of such scum;
and if it is answered in the negative, our nation is pitifully poor in human
beings.On such days of reflection and cogitation, I pondered with anxious
concern on the masses of those no longer belonging to their people and saw
them swelling to the proportions of a menacing army.With what changed feeling I now gazed at the endless columns
of a mass demonstration of Viennese workers that took place one day as they
marched past four abreast! For neatly two hours I stood there watching with
bated breath the gigantic human dragon slowly winding by. In oppressed anxiety,
I finally left the place and sauntered homeward. In a tobacco shop on the
way I saw the Arbeiter-Zeitung, the central organ of the old Austrian Social
Democracy. It was available in a cheap people's cafe, to which I often went
to read newspapers; but up to that time I had not been able to bring myself
to spend more than two minutes on the miserable sheet, whose whole tone
affected me like moral vitriol. Depressed by the demonstration, I was driven
on by an inner voice to buy the sheet and read it carefully. That evening
I did so, fighting down the fury that rose up in me from time to time at
this concentrated solution of lies.More than any theoretical literature, my daily reading of the
Social Democratic press enabled me to study the inner nature of these thought-processes.For what a difference between the glittering phrases about freedom,
beauty, and dignity in the theoretical literature, the delusive welter of
words seemingly expressing the most profound and laborious wisdom, the loathsome
humanitarian morality- all this written with the incredible gall that comes
with prophetic certainty-and the brutal daily press, shunning no villainy,
employing every means of slander, lying with a virtuosity that would bend
iron beams, all in the name of this gospel of a new humanity. The one is
addressed to the simpletons of the middle, not to mention the upper, educated,
'classes,' the other to the masses.For me immersion in the literature and press of this doctrine
and organization meant finding my way back to my own people.
What had seemed to me an unbridgable gulf became the source of a greater
love than ever before.Only a fool can behold the work of this villainous poisoner
and still condemn the victim. The more independent I made myself in the
next few years the clearer grew my perspective, hence my insight into the
inner causes of the Social Democratic successes. I now understood the significance
of the brutal demand that I read only Red papers, attend only Red meetings,
read only Red books, etc. With plastic clarity I saw before my eyes the
inevitable result of this doctrine of intolerance.The psyche of the great masses is not receptive to anything
that is half-hearted and weak.Like the woman, whose psychic state is determined less by grounds
of abstract reason than by an indefinable emotional longing for a force
which will complement her nature, and who, consequently, would rather bow
to a strong man than dominate a weakling, likewise the masses love a commander
more than a petitioner and feel inwardly more satisfied by a doctrine, tolerating
no other beside itself, than by the granting of liberalistic freedom with
which, as a rule, they can do little, and are prone to feel that they have
been abandoned. They are equally unaware of their shameless spiritual terrorization
and the hideous abuse of their human freedom, for they absolutely fail to
suspect the inner insanity of the whole doctrine. All they see is the ruthless
force and brutality of its calculated manifestations, to which they always
submit in the end.If Social Democracy is opposed by a doctrine of greater truth,
but equal brutality of methods, the latter will conquer, though this may
require the bitterest struggle.Before two years had passed, the theory as well as the technical
methods of Social Democracy were clear to me.I understood the infamous spiritual terror which this movement
exerts, particularly on the bourgeoisie, which is neither morally nor mentally
equal to such attacks; at a given sign it unleashes a veritable barrage
of lies and slanders against whatever adversary seems most dangerous, until
the nerves of the attacked persons break down and, just to have peace again,
they sacrifice the hated individual.However, the fools obtain no peace.The game begins again and is repeated over and over until fear
of the mad dog results in suggestive paralysis.Since the Social Democrats best know the value of force from
their own experience, they most violently attack those in whose nature they
detect any of this substance which is so rare. Conversely, they praise every
weakling on the opposing side, sometimes cautiously, sometimes loudly, depending
on the real or supposed quality of his intelligence.They fear an irnpotent, spineless genius less than a forceful
nature of moderate intelligence.But with the greatest enthusiasm they commend weaklings in both
mind and force.They know how to create the illusion that this is the only way
of preserving the peace, and at the same time, stealthily but steadily,
they conquer one position after another, sometimes by silent blackmail,
sometimes by actual theft, at moments when the general attention is directed
toward other matters, and either does not want to be disturbed or considers
the matter too small to raise a stir about, thus again irritating the vicious
antagonist.This is a tactic based on precise calculation of all human weaknesses,
and its result will lead to success with almost mathematical certainty unless
the opposing side learns to combat poison gas with poison gas.It is our duty to inform all weaklings that this is a question
of to be or not to be.
I achieved an equal understanding of the importance of physical terror toward
the individual and the masses.Here, too, the psychological effect can be calculated with precision.Terror at the place of employment, in the factory, in the meeting
hall, and on the occasion of mass demonstrations will always be successful
unless opposed by equal terror.In this case, to be sure, the party will cry bloody murder;
though it has long despised all state authority, it will set up a howling
cry for that same authority and in most cases will actually attain its goal
amid the general confusion: it will find some idiot of a higher official
who, in the imbecilic hope of propitiating the feared adversary for later
eventualities, will help this world plague to break its opponent.The impression made by such a success on the minds of the great
masses of supporters as well as opponents can only be measured by those
who know the soul of a people, not from books, but from life. For while
in the ranks of their supporters the victory achieved seems a triumph of
the justice of their own cause, the defeated adversary in most cases despairs
of the success of any further resistance.The more familiar I became, principally with the methods of
physical terror, the more indulgent I grew toward all the hundreds of thousands
who succumbed to it.What makes me most indebted to that period of suffering is that
it alone gave back to me my people, taught me to distinguish the victims
from their seducers.The results of this seduction can be designated only as victims.
For if I attempted to draw a few pictures from life, depicting the essence
of these 'lowest' classes, my picture would not be complete without the
assurance that in these depths I also found bright spots in the form of
a rare willingness to make sacrifices, of loyal comradeship, astonishing
frugality, and modest reserve, especially among the older workers. Even
though these virtues were steadily vanishing in the younger generation,
if only through the general effects of the big city, there were many, even
among the young men, whose healthy blood managed to dominate the foul tricks
of life. If in their political activity, these good, often kind-hearted
people nevertheless joined the mortal enemies of our nationality, thus helping
to cement their ranks, the reason was that they neither understood nor could
understand the baseness of the new doctrine, and that no one else took the
trouble to bother about them, and finally that the social conditions were
stronger than any will to the contrary that may have been present. The poverty
to which they sooner or later succumbed drove them into the camp of the
Social Democracy.Since on innumerable occasions the bourgeoisie has in the clumsiest
and most immoral way opposed demands which were justified from the universal
human point of view, often without obtaining or even justifiably expecting
any profit from such an attitude, even the most self-respecting worker was
driven out of the trade-union organization into political activity.Millions of workers, I am sure, started out as enemies of the
Social Democratic Party in their innermost soul, but their resistance was
overcome in a way which was sometimes utterly insane; that is, when the
bourgeois parties adopted a hostile attitude toward every demand of a social
character. Their simple, narrow-minded rejection of all attempts to better
working conditions, to introduce safety devices on machines, to prohibit
child labor and protect the woman, at least in the months when she was bearing
the future national comrade under her heart, contributed to drive the masses
into the net of Social Democracy which gratefully snatched at every case
of such a disgraceful attitude. Never can our political bourgeoisie make
good its sins in this direction, for by resisting all attempts to do away
with social abuses, they sowed hatred and seemed to justify even the assertions
of the mortal enemies of the entire nation, to the effect that only the
Social Democratic Party represented the interests of the working peopleThus, to begin with, they created the moral basis for the actual
existence of the trade unions, the organization which has always been the
most effective pander to the political party.In my Viennese years I was forced, whether I liked it or not,
to take a position on the trade unions.Since I regarded them as an inseparable ingredient of the Social
Democratic Party as such, my decision was instantaneous and-mistaken.I flatly rejected them without thinking.And in this infinite]y important question, as in so many others,
Fate itself became my instructor.The result was a reversal of my first judgment.By my twentieth year I had learned to distinguish between a
union as a means of defending the general social rights of the wage-earner,
and obtaining better living conditions for him as an individual, and the
trade union as an instrument of the party in the political class struggle.The fact that Social Democracy understood the enormous importance
of the trade-union movement assured it of this instrument and hence of success;
the fact that the bourgeoisie were not aware of this cost them their political
position. They thought they could stop a logical development by means of
an impertinent 'rejection,' but in reality they only forced it into illogical
channels. For to call the trade-union movement in itself unpatriotic is
nonsense and untrue to boot. Rather the contrary is true. If trade-union
activity strives and succeeds in bettering the lot of a class which is one
of the basic supports of the nation, its work is not only not anti-patriotic
or seditious, but 'national' in the truest sense of the word. For in this
way it helps to create the social premises without which a general national
education is unthinkable. It wins the highest merit by eliminating social
cankers, attacking intellectual as well as physical infections, and thus
helping to contribute to the general health of the body politic.Consequently, the question of their necessity is really superfluous.As long as there are employers with little social understanding
or a deficient sense of justice and propriety, it is not only the right
but the duty of their employees, who certainly constitute a part of our
nationality, to protect the interests of the general public against the
greed and unreason of the individual; for the preservation of loyalty and
faith in z social group is just as much to the interest of a nation as the
preservation of the people's health.Both of these are seriously menaced by unworthy employers who
do not feel themselves to be members of the national community as a whole.
From the disastrous effects of their greed or ruthlessness grow profound
evils for the future.To eliminate the causes of such a development is to do a service
to the nation and in no sense the opposite.Let no one say that every individual is free to draw the consequences
from an actual or supposed injustice; in other words, to leave his job.
No ! This is shadow-boxing and must be regarded as an attempt to divert
attention. Either the elimination of bad, unsocial conditions serves the
interest of the nation or it does not. If it does, the struggle against
then must be carried on with weapons which offer the hope of success. The
individual worker, however, is never in a position to defend himself against
the power of the great industrialist, for in such matters it cannot be superior
justice that conquers (if that were recognized, the whole struggle would
stop from lack of cause)-no, what matters here is superior power. Otherwise
the sense of justice alone would bring the struggle to a fair conclusion,
or, more accurately speaking, the struggle could never arise.No, if the unsocial or unworthy treatment of men calls for resistance,
this struggle, as long as no legal judicial authorities have been created
for the elimination of these evils, can only be decided by superior power.
And this makes it obvious that the power of the employer concentrated in
a single person can only be countered by the mass of employees banded into
a single person, if the possibility of a victory is not to be renounced
in advance.Thus, trade-union organization can lead to a strengthening of
the social idea in its practical effects on daily life, and thereby to an
elimination of irritants which are constantly giving cause for dissatisfaction
and complaints.If this is not the case, it is to a great extent the fault of
those who have been able to place obstacles in the path of any legal regulation
of social evils or thwart them by means of their political influence.Proportionately as the political bourgeoisie did not understand,
or rather did not want to understand, the importance of trade-union organization,
and resisted it, the Social Democrats took possession of the contested movement.
Thus, far-sightedly it created a firm foundation which on several critical
occasions has stood up when all other supports failed. In this way the intrinsic
purpose was gradually submerged, making place for new aims.It never occurred to the Social Democrats to limit the movement
they had thus captured to its original task.No, that was far from their intention.In a few decades the weapon for defending the social rights
of man had, in their experienced hands? become an instrument for the destruction
of the national economy. And they did not let themselves be hindered in
the least by the interests of the workers. For in politics, as in other
fields, the use of economic pressure always permits blackmail, as long as
the necessary unscrupulousness is present on the one side, and sufficient
sheeplike patience on the other.Something which in this case was true of both sidesBy the turn of the century, the trade-union movement had
ceased to serve its former function. From year to year it had entered more
and more into the sphere of Social Democratic politics and finally had no
use except as a battering-ram in the class struggle. Its purpose was to
cause the collapse of the whole arduously constructed economic edifice by
persistent blows, thus, the more easily, after removing its economic foundations,
to prepare the same lot for the edifice of state. Less and less attention
was paid to defending the real needs of the working class, and finally political
expediency made it seem undesirable to relieve the social or cultural miseries
of the broad masses at all, for otherwise there was a risk that these masses,
satisfied in their desires could no longer be used forever as docile shock
troops.The leaders of the class struggle looked on this development
with such dark foreboding and dread that in the end they rejected any really
beneficial social betterment out of hand, and actually attacked it with
the greatest determination.And they were never at a loss for an explanation of a line of
behavior which seemed so inexplicable.By screwing the demands higher and higher, they made their possible
fulfillment seem so trivial and unimportant that they were able at all times
to tell the masses that they were dealing with nothing but a diabolical
attempt to weaken, if possible in fact to paralyze, the offensive power
of the working class in the cheapest way, by such a ridiculous satisfaction
of the most elementary rights. In view of the great masses' small capacity
for thought, we need not be surprised at the success of these methods.The bourgeois camp was indignant at this obvious insincerity
of Social Democratic tactics, but did not draw from it the slightest inference
with regard to their own conduct. The Social Democrats' fear of really raising
the working class out of the depths of their cultural and social misery
should have inspired the greatest exertions in this very direction, thus
gradually wrestling the weapon from the hands of the advocates of the class
struggle.This, however, was not done.Instead of attacking and seizing the enemy's position, the bourgeoisie
preferred to let themselves
be pressed to the wall and finally had recourse to utterly inadequate makeshifts,
which remained ineffectual because they came too late, and, moreover, were
easy to reject because they were too insignificant. Thus. in reality, everything
remained as before, except that the discontent was greater.Like a menacing storm-cloud, the ' free trade union ' hung,
even then, over the political horizon and the existence of the individual.It was one of the most frightful instruments of terror against
the security and independence of the national economy, the solidity of the
state, and personal freedom.And chiefly this was what made the concept of democracy a sordid
and ridiculous phrase, and held up brotherhood to everlasting scorn in the
words: 'And if our comrade you won't be, we'll bash your head in-one, two,
three ! 'And that was how I became acquainted with this friend of humanity.
In the course of the years my view was broadened and deepened, but I have
had no need to change it.
The greater insight I gathered into the external character of Social Democracy,
the greater became my longing to comprehend the inner core of this doctrine.
The official party literature was not much use for this purpose. In so far
as it deals with economic questions, its assertions and proofs are false;
in so far as it treats of political aims, it lies. Moreover, I was inwardly
repelled by the newfangled pettifogging phraseology and the style in which
it was written. With an enormous expenditure of words, unclear in content
or incomprehensible as to meaning, they stammer an endless hodgepodge of
phrases purportedly as witty as in reality they are meaningless. Only our
decadent metropolitan bohemians can feel at home in this maze of reasoning
and cull an 'inner experience' from this dung-heap of literary dadaism,
supported by the proverbial modesty of a section of our people who always
detect profound wisdom in what is most incomprehensible to them personally.
However, by balancing the theoretical untruth and nonsense of this doctrine
with the reality of the phenomenon, I gradually obtained a clear picture
of its intrinsic will.At such times I was overcome by gloomy foreboding and malignant
fear. Then I saw before me a doctrine, comprised of egotism and hate, which
can lead to victory pursuant to mathematical laws, but in so doing must
put an end to humanity.Meanwhile, I had learned to understand the connection between
this doctrine of destruction and the nature of a people of which, up to
that time, I had known next to nothing.Only a knowledge of the Jews provides the key with which to
comprehend the inner, and consequently real, aims of Social Democracy.The erroneous conceptions of the aim and meaning of this party
fall from our eyes like veils, once we come to know this people, and from
the fog and mist of social phrases rises the leering grimace of Marxism.Today it is difficult, if not impossible, for me to say when
the word 'Jew ' first gave me ground for special thoughts. At home I do
not remember having heard the word during my father's lifetime. I believe
that the old gentleman would have regarded any special emphasis on this
term as cultural backwardness. In the course of his life he had arrived
at more or less cosmopolitan views which, despite his pronounced national
sentiments, not only remained intact, but also affected me to some extent.Likewise at school I found no occasion which could have led
me to change this inherited picture.At the Realschule, to be sure, I did meet one Jewish boy who
was treated by all of us with caution, but only because various experiences
had led us to doubt his discretion and we did not particularly trust him;
but neither I nor the others had any thoughts on the matter.Not until my fourteenth or fifteenth year did I begin to come
across the word 'Jew,' with any frequency, partly in connection with political
discussions. This filled me with a mild distaste, and I could not rid myself
of an unpleasant feeling that always came over me whenever religious quarrels
occurred in my presence.At that time I did not think anything else of the question.There were few Jews in Linz. In the course of the centuries
their outward appearance had become Europeanized and had taken on a human
look; in fact, I even took them for Germans. The absurdity of this idea
did not dawn on me because I saw no distinguishing feature but the strange
religion. The fact that they had, as I believed, been persecuted on this
account sometimes almost turned my distaste at unfavorable remarks about
them into horror.Thus far I did not so much as suspect the existence of an organized
opposition to the Jews.Then I came to Vienna.Preoccupied by the abundance of my impressions in the architectural
field, oppressed by the hardship of my own lot, I gained at first no insight
into the inner stratification of the people in this gigantic city. Notwithstanding
that Vienna in those days counted nearly two hundred thousand Jews among
its two million inhabitants, I did not see them. In the first few weeks
my eyes and my senses were not equal to the flood of values and ideas. Not
until calm gradually returned and the agitated picture began to clear did
I look around me more carefully in my new world, and then among other things
I encountered the Jewish question.I cannot maintain that the way in which I became acquainted
with them struck me as particularly pleasant. For the Jew was still characterized
for me by nothing but his religion, and therefore, on grounds of human tolerance,
I maintained my rejection of religious attacks in this case as in others.
Consequently, the tone, particularly that of the Viennese antiSemitic press,
seemed to me unworthy of the cultural tradition of a great nation. I was
oppressed by the memory of certain occurrences in the Middle Ages, which
I should not have liked to see repeated. Since the newspapers in question
did not enjoy an outstanding reputation (the reason for this, at that time,
I myself did not precisely know), I regarded them more as the products of
anger and envy than the results of 4 principled though perhaps mistaken,
point of view.I was reinforced in this opinion by what seemed to me the far
more dignified form in which the really big papers answered all these attacks,
or, what seemed to me even more praiseworthy, failed to mention them; in
other words, simply killed them with silence.I zealously read the so-called world press (Neue Freie Presse,
Wiener Tageblatt, etc.) and was amazed at the scope of what they offered
their readers and the objectivity of individual articles. I respected the
exalted tone, though the flamboyance of the style sometimes caused me inner
dissatisfaction, or even struck me unpleasantly. Yet this may have been
due to the rhythm of life in the whole metropolis.Since in those days I saw Vienna in that light, I thought myself
justified in accepting this explanation of mine as a valid excuse.But what sometimes repelled me was the undignified fashion in
which this press curried favor with the Court. There was scarcely an event
in the Hofburg which was not imparted to the readers either with raptures
of enthusiasm or plaintive emotion, and all this to-do, particularly when
it dealt with the 'wisest monarch' of all time, almost reminded me of the
mating cry of a mountain cock.To me the whole thing seemed artificial.In my eyes it was a blemish upon liberal democracy.To curry favor with this Court and in such indecent forms was
to sacrifice the dignity of the nation.This was the first shadow to darken my intellectual relationship
with the ' big ' Viennese press.As I had always done before, I continued in Vienna to follow
events in Germany with ardent zeal, quite regardless whether they were political
or cultural. With pride and admiration, I compared the rise of the Reich
with the wasting away of the Austrian state. If events in the field of foreign
politics filled me, by and large, with undivided joy, the less gratifying
aspects of internal life often aroused anxiety and gloom. a he struggle
which at that time was being carried on against William II did not meet
with my approval. I regarded him not only as the German Emperor, but first
and foremost as the creator of a German fleet. The restrictions of speech
imposed on the Kaiser by the Reichstag angered me greatly because they emanated
from a source which in my opinion really hadn't a leg to stand on, since
in a single session these parliamentarian imbeciles gabbled more nonsense
than a whole dynasty of emperors, including its very weakest numbers, could
ever have done in centuries.I was outraged that in a state where every idiot not only claimed
the right to criticize, but was given a seat in the Reichstag and let loose
upon the nation as a 'lawgiver,' the man who bore the imperial crown had
to take 'reprimands' from the greatest babblers' club of all time.But I was even more indignant that the same Viennese press which
made the most obsequious bows to every rickety horse in the Court, and flew
into convulsions of joy if he accidentally swished his tail, should, with
supposed concern, yet, as it seemed to me, ill-concealed malice, express
its criticisms of the German Kaiser. Of course it had no intention of interfering
with conditions within the German Reich-oh, no, God forbid-but by placing
its finger on these wounds in the friendliest way, it was fulfilling the
duty imposed by the spirit of the mutual alliance, and, conversely, fulfilling
the requirements of journalistic truth, etc. And now it was poking this
finger around in the wound to its heart's content.In such cases the blood rose to my head.It was this which caused me little by little to view the big
papers with greater caution.And on one such occasion I was forced to recognize that one
of the anti-Semitic papers, the Deutsches Volksblatt, behaved more decently.Another thing that got on my nerves was the loathsome cult for
France which the big press, even then, carried on. A man couldn't help feeling
ashamed to be a German when he saw these saccharine hymns of praise to the
'great cultural nation.' This wretched licking of France's boots more than
once made me throw down one of these 'world newspapers.' And on such occasions
I sometimes picked up the Volksblatt, which, to be sure, seemed to me much
smaller, but in these matters somewhat more appetizing. I was not in agreement
with the sharp antiSemitic tone, but from time to time I read arguments
which gave me some food for thought.At all events, these occasions slowly made me acquainted with
the man and the movement, which in those days guided Vienna's destinies:
Dr. Karl Lueger I and the Christian Social Party.When I arrived in Vienna, I was hostile to both of them.The man and the movement seemed 'reactionary' in my eyes.My common sense of justice, however, forced me to change this
judgment in proportion as I had occasion to become acquainted with the man
and his work; and slowly my fair judgment turned to unconcealed admiration.
Today, more than ever, I regard this man as the greatest German mayor of
all times.How many of my basic principles were upset by this change in
my attitude toward the Christian Social movement!My views with regard to anti-Semitism thus succumbed to the
passage of time, and this was my greatest transformation of all.It cost me the greatest inner soul struggles, and only after
months of battle between my reason and my sentiments did my reason begin
to emerge victorious. Two years later, my sentiment had followed my reason,
and from then on became its most loyal guardian and sentinel.At the time of this bitter struggle between spiritual education
and cold reason, the visual instruction of the Vienna streets had performed
invaluable services. There came a time when I no longer, as in the first
days, wandered blindly through the mighty city; now with open eyes I saw
not only the buildings but also the people.Once, as I was strolling through the Inner City, I suddenly
encountered an apparition in a black caftan and black hair locks. Is this
a Jew? was my first thought.For, to be sure, they had not looked like that in Linz. I observed
the man furtively and cautiously, but the longer I stared at this foreign
face, scrutinizing feature for feature, the more my first question assumed
a new form:Is this a German?As always in such cases, I now began to try to relieve my doubts
by books. For a few hellers I bought the first antiSemitic pamphlets of
my life. Unfortunately, they all proceeded from the supposition that in
principle the reader knew or even understood the Jewish question to a certain
degree. Besides, the tone for the most part was such that doubts again arose
in me, due in part to the dull and amazingly unscientific arguments favoring
the thesis.I relapsed for weeks at a time, once even for months.The whole thing seemed to me so monstrous, the accusations so
boundless, that, tormented by the fear of doing injustice, I again became
anxious and uncertain.Yet I could no longer very well doubt that the objects of my
study were not Germans of a special religion, but a people in themselves;
for since I had begun to concern myself with this question and to take cognizance
of the Jews, Vienna appeared to me in a different light than before. Wherever
I went, I began to see Jews, and the more I saw, the more sharply they became
distinguished in my eyes from the rest of humanity. Particularly the Inner
City and the districts north of the Danube Canal swarmed with a people which
even outwardly had lost all resemblance to Germans.And whatever doubts I may still have nourished were finally
dispelled by the attitude of a portion of the Jews themselves.Among them there was a great movement, quite extensive in Vienna,
which came out sharply in confirmation of the national character of the
Jews: this was the Zionists.It looked to be sure, as though only a part of the Jews approved
this viewpoint, while the great majority condemned and inwardly rejected
such a formulation. But when examined more closely, this appearance dissolved
itself into an unsavory vapor of pretexts advanced for mere reasons of expedience,
not to say lies. For the so-called liberal Jews did not reject the Zionists
as non-Jews, but only as Jews with an impractical, perhaps even dangerous,
way of publicly avowing their Jewishness.Intrinsically they remained unalterably of one piece.In a short time this apparent struggle between Zionistic and
liberal Jews disgusted me; for it was false through and through, founded
on lies and scarcely in keeping with the moral elevation and purity always
claimed by this people.The cleanliness of this people, moral and otherwise, I must
say, is a point in itself. By their very exterior you could tell that these
were no lovers of water, and, to your distress, you often knew it with your
eyes closed. Later I often grew sick to my stomach from the smell of these
caftan-wearers. Added to this, there was their unclean dress and their generally
unheroic appearance.All this could scarcely be called very attractive; but it became
positively repulsive when, in addition to their physical uncleanliness,
you discovered the moral stains on this 'chosen people.'In a short time I was made more thoughtful than ever by my slowly
rising insight into the type of activity carried on by the Jews in certain
fields.
Was there any form of filth or profligacy, particularly in cultural life,
without at least one Jew involved in it?If you cut even cautiously into such an abscess, you found,
like a maggot in a rotting body, often dazzled by the sudden light-a kike!What had to be reckoned heavily against the Jews in my eyes
was when I became acquainted with their activity in the press, art, literature,
and the theater. All the unctuous reassurances helped little or nothing
It sufficed to look at a billboard, to study the names of the men behind
the horrible trash they advertised, to make you hard for a long time to
come. This was pestilence, spiritual pestilence, worse than the Black Death
of olden times, and the people was being infected with it! It goes without
saying that the lower the intellectual level of one of these art manufacturers,
the more unlimited his fertility will be, and the scoundrel ends up like
a garbage separator, splashing his filth in the face of humanity. And bear
in mind that there is no limit to their number; bear in mind that for one
Goethe Nature easily can foist on the world ten thousand of these scribblers
who poison men's souls like germ-carriers of the worse sort, on their fellow
men.It was terrible, but not to be overlooked, that precisely the
Jew, in tremendous numbers, seemed chosen by Nature for this shameful calling.Is this why the Jews are called the 'chosen people'?I now began to examine carefully the names of all the creators
of unclean products in public artistic life. The result was less and less
favorable for my previous attitude toward the Jews. Regardless how my sentiment
might resists my reason was forced to draw its conclusions.The fact that nine tenths of all literary filth, artistic trash,
and theatrical idiocy can be set to the account of a people, constituting
hardly one hundredth of all the country's inhabitants, could simply not
be tanked away; it was the plain truth.And I now began to examine my beloved 'world press' from this
point of view.And the deeper I probed, the more the object of my former admiration
shriveled. The style became more and more unbearable; I could not help rejecting
the content as inwardly shallow and banal; the objectivity of exposition
now seemed to me more akin to lies than honest truth; and the writers were-Jews.A thousand things which I had hardly seen before now struck
my notice, and others, which had previously given me food for thought, I
now learned to grasp and understand.I now saw the liberal attitude of this press in a different
light; the lofty tone in which it answered attacks and its method of I killing
them with silence now revealed itself to me as a trick as clever as it was
treacherous; the transfigured raptures of their theatrical critics were
always directed at Jewish writers, and their disapproval never struck anyone
but Germans. The gentle pinpricks against William II revealed its methods
by their persistency, and so did its commendation of French culture and
civilization. The trashy content of the short story now appeared to me |
as outright indecency, and in the language I detected the accents 0 of a
foreign people; the sense of the whole thing was so obviously hostile to
Germanism that this could only have been intentional.But who had an interest in this?Was all this a mere accident?Gradually I became uncertain.The development was accelerated by insights which I gained into
a number of other matters. I am referring to the general view of 1. ethics
and morals which was quite openly exhibited by a large part of the Jews,
and the practical application of which could be seen.Here again the streets provided an object lesson of a sort which
was sometimes positively evil.The relation of the Jews to prostitution and, even more, to
the white-slave traffic, could be studied in Vienna as perhaps in no other
city of Western Europe, with the possible exception of the southern French
ports. If you walked at night through the streets and alleys of Leopoldstadt
at every step you witnessed proceedings which remained concealed from the
majority of the German people until the War gave the soldiers on the eastern
front occasion to see similar things, or, better expressed, forced them
to see them.When thus for the first time I recognized the Jew as the cold-hearted,
shameless, and calculating director of this revolting vice traffic in the
scum of the big city, a cold shudder ran down my back.But then a flame flared up within me. I no longer avoided discussion
of the Jewish question; no, now I sought it. And when I learned to look
for the Jew in all branches of cultural and artistic life and its various
manifestations, I suddenly encountered him in a place where I would least
have expected to find him.When I recognized the Jew as the leader of the Social Democracy,
the scales dropped from my eyes. A long soul struggle had reached its conclusion.Even in my daily relations with my fellow workers, I observed
the amazing adaptability with which they adopted different positions on
the same question, sometimes within an interval of a few days, sometimes
in only a few hours. It was hard for me to understand how people who, when
spoken to alone, possessed some sensible opinions, suddenly lost them as
soon as they came under the influence of the masses. It was often enough
to make one despair. When, after hours of argument, I was convinced that
now at last I had broken the ice or cleared up some absurdity, and was beginning
to rejoice at my success, on the next day to my disgust I had to begin all
over again; it had all been in vain. Like an eternal pendulum their opinions
seemed to swing back again and again to the old madness.All this I could understand: that they were dissatisfied with
their lot and cursed the Fate which often struck them so harshly; that they
hated the employers who seemed to them the heartless bailiffs of Fate; that
they cursed the authorities who in their eyes were without feeling for their
situation; that they demonstrated against food prices and carried their
demands into the streets: this much could be understood without recourse
to reason. But what inevitably remained incomprehensible was the boundless
hatred they heaped upon their own nationality, despising its greatness,
besmirching its history, and dragging its great men into the gutter.This struggle against their own species, their own clan, their
own homeland, was as senseless as it was incomprehensible. It was unnatural.It was possible to cure them temporarily of this vice, but only
for days or at most weeks. If later you met the man you thought you had
converted, he was just the same as before.His old unnatural state had regained full possession of him.I gradually became aware that the Social Democratic press
was directed predominantly by Jews; yet I did not attribute any special
significance to this circumstance, since conditions were exactly the same
in the other papers. Yet one fact seemed conspicuous: there was not one
paper with Jews working on it which could have been regarded as truly national
according to my education and way of thinking.I swallowed my disgust and tried to read this type of Marxist
press production, but my revulsion became so unlimited in so doing that
I endeavored to become more closely acquainted with the men who manufactured
these compendiums of knavery.From the publisher down, they were all Jews.I took all the Social Democratic pamphlets I could lay hands
on and sought the names of their authors: Jews. I noted the names of the
leaders; by far the greatest part were likewise members of the 'chosen people,'
whether they were representatives in the Reichsrat or trade-union secretaries,
the heads of organizations or street agitators. It was always the same gruesome
picture. The names of the Austerlitzes, Davids, Adlers, Ellenbogens, etc.,
will remain forever graven in my memory. One thing had grown dear to me:
the party with whose petty representatives I had been carrying on the most
violent struggle for months was, as to leadership, almost exclusively in
the hands of a foreign people; for, to my deep and joyful satisfaction,
I had at last come to the conclusion that the Jew was no German.Only now did I become thoroughly acquainted with the seducer
of our people.A single year of my sojourn in Vienna had sufficed to imbue
me with the conviction that no worker could be so stubborn that he would
not in the end succumb to better knowledge and better explanations. Slowly
I had become an expert in their own doctrine and used it as a weapon in
the struggle for my own profound conviction.Success almost always favored my side.The great masses could be saved, if only with the gravest sacrifice
in time and patience.But a Jew could never be parted from his opinions.At that time I was still childish enough to try to make the
madness of their doctrine clear to them; in my little circle I talked my
tongue sore and my throat hoarse, thinking I would inevitably succeed in
convincing them how ruinous their Marxist madness was; but what I accomplished
was often the opposite. It seemed as though their increased understanding
of the destructive effects of Social Democratic theories and their results
only reinforced their determination.The more I argued with them, the better I came to know their
dialectic. First they counted on the stupidity of their adversary, and then,
when there was no other way out, they themselves simply played stupid. If
all this didn't help, they pretended not to understand, or, if challenged,
they changed the subject in a hurry, quoted platitudes which, if you accepted
them, they immediately related to entirely different matters, and then,
if again attacked, gave ground and pretended not to know exactly what you
were talking about. Whenever you tried to attack one of these apostles,
your hand closed on a jelly-like slime which divided up and poured through
your fingers, but in the next moment collected again. But if you really
struck one of these fellows so telling a blow that, observed by the audience,
he couldn't help but agree, and if you believed that this had taken you
at least one step forward, your amazement was great the next day. The Jew
had not the slightest recollection of the day before, he rattled off his
same old nonsense as though nothing at all had happened, and, if indignantly
challenged, affected amazement; he couldn't remember a thing, except that
he had proved the correctness of his assertions the previous day.Sometimes I stood there thunderstruck.I didn't know what to be more amazed at: the agility of their
tongues or their virtuosity at lying.Gradually I began to hate them.All this had but one good side: that in proportion as the real
leaders or at least the disseminators of Social Democracy came within my
vision, my love for my people inevitably grew. For who, in view of the diabolical
craftiness of these seducers, could damn the luckless victims? How hard
it was, even for me, to get the better of thus race of dialectical liars
! And how futile was such success in dealing with people who twist the truth
in your mouth who without so much as a blush disavow the word they have
just spoken, and in the very next minute take credit for it after all.No. The better acquainted I became with the Jew, the more forgiving
I inevitably became toward the worker. In my eyes the gravest fault was
no longer with him, but with all those who did not regard it as worth the
trouble to have mercy on him, with iron righteousness giving the son of
the people his just deserts, and standing the seducer and corrupter up against
the wall.Inspired by the experience of daily life, I now began to track
down the sources of the Marxist doctrine. Its effects had become clear to
me in individual cases; each day its success was apparent to my attentive
eyes, and, with some exercise of my imagination, I was able to picture the
consequences. The only remaining question was whether the result of their
action in its ultimate form had existed in the mind's eye of the creators,
or whether they themselves were the victims of an error.I felt that both were possible.In the one case it was the duty of every thinking man to force
himself to the forefront of the ilI-starred movement, thus perhaps averting
catastrophe; in the other, however, the original founders of this plague
of the nations must have been veritable devils- for only in the brain of
a monster-not that of a man-could the plan of an organization assume form
and meaning, whose activity must ultimately result in the collapse of human
civilization and the consequent devastation of the world.In this case the only remaining hope was struggle, struggle
with all the weapons which the human spirit, reason, and will can devise,
regardless on which side of the scale Fate should lay its blessing.Thus I began to make myself familiar with the founders of this
doctrine, in order to study the foundations of the movement. If I reached
my goal more quickly than at first I had perhaps ventured to believe, it
was thanks to my newly acquired, though at that time not very profound,
knowledge of the Jewish question. This alone enabled me to draw a practical
comparison between the reality and the theoretical flim-flam of the founding
fathers of Social Democracy, since it taught me to understand the language
of the Jewish people, who speak in order to conceal or at least to veil
their thoughts; their real aim is not therefore to be found in the lines
themselves, but slumbers well concealed between them.For or me this was the time of the greatest spiritual upheaval
I have ever had to go through.I had ceased to be a weak-kneed cosmopolitan and become an anti-Semite.Just once more-and this was the last time-fearful, oppressive
thoughts came to me in profound anguish.When over long periods of human history I scrutinized the activity
of the Jewish people, suddenly there rose up in me the fearful question
whether inscrutable Destiny, perhaps Or reasons unknown to us poor mortals,
did not with eternal and immutable resolve, desire the final victory of
this little nation.Was it possible that the earth had been promised as a reward
to this people which lives only for this earth?Have we an objective right to struggle for our self-preservation,
or is this justified only subjectively within ourselves?As I delved more deeply into the teachings of Marxism and thus
in tranquil clarity submitted the deeds of the Jewish people to contemplation,
Fate itself gave me its answer.The Jewish doctrine of Marxism rejects the aristocratic principle
of Nature and replaces the eternal privilege of power and strength by the
mass of numbers and their dead weight. Thus it denies the value of personality
in man, contests the significance of nationality and race, and thereby withdraws
from humanity the premise of its existence and its culture. As a foundation
of the universe, this doctrine would bring about the end of any order intellectually
conceivable to man. And as, in this greatest of ail recognizable organisms,
the result of an application of such a law could only be chaos, on earth
it could only be destruction for the inhabitants of this planet.If, with the help of his Marxist creed, the Jew is victorious
over the other peoples of the world, his crown will be the funeral wreath
of humanity and this planet will, as it did thousands l of years ago, move
through the ether devoid of men.Eternal Nature inexorably avenges the infringement of her commands.Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the
will of the Almighty Creator: by defending myself against the Jew, I am
fighting for the work of the Lord.


TODAY it is my conviction that in general, aside from cases
of unusual talent, a man should not engage in public political activity
before his thirtieth year. He should not do so, because up to this time,
as a rule, he is engaged in molding a general platform, on the basis of
which he proceeds to examine the various political problems and finally
establishes his own position on them. Only after he has acquired such a
basic philosophy, and the resultant firmness of outlook on the special problems
of the day, is he, inwardly at least, mature enough to be justified in partaking
in the political leadership of the general public.Otherwise he runs the risk of either having to change his former
position on essential questions, or, contrary to his better knowledge and
understanding, of clinging to a view which reason and conviction have long
since discarded. In the former case this is most embarrassing to him personally,
since, what with his own vacillations, he cannot justifiably expect the
faith of his adherents to follow him with the same unswerving firmness as
before; for those led by him, on the other hand, such a reversal on the
part of the leader means perplexity and not rarely a certain feeling of
shame toward those whom they hitherto opposed. In the second case, there
occurs a thing which, particularly today, often confronts us: in the same
measure as the leader ceases to believe in what he says, his arguments become
shallow and flat, but he tries to make up for it by vileness in his choice
of means. While he himself has given up all idea of fighting seriously for
his political revelations (a man does not die for something which he himself
does not believe in), his demands on his supporters become correspondingly
greater and more shameless until he ends up by sacrificing the last shred
of leadership and turning into a 'politician; in other words, the kind of
man whose onlv real conviction is lack of conviction, combined with offensive
impertinence and an art of lying, often developed to the point of complete
shamelessness.If to the misfortune of decent people such a character gets
into a parliament, we may as well realize at once that the essence of his
politics will from now on consist in nothing but an heroic struggle for
the permanent possession of his feeding-bottle for himself and his family.
The more his wife and children depend on it, the more tenaciously he will
fight for his mandate. This alone will make every other man with political
instincts his personal enemy; in every new movement he will scent the possible
beginning of his end, and in every man of any greatness the danger which
menaces him through that man.I shall have more to say about this type of parliamentary bedbug.Even a man of thirty will have much to learn in the course of
his life, but this will only be to supplement and fill in the framework
provided him by the philosophy he has basically adopted When he learns,
his learning will not have to be a revision of principle, but a supplementary
study, and his supporters will not have to choke down the oppressive feeling
that they have hitherto been falsely instructed by him. On the contrary:
the visible organic growth of the leader will give them satisfaction, for
when he learns, he will only be deepening their own philosophy. And this
in their eyes will be a proof for the correctness of the views they have
hitherto held.
A leader who must depart from the platform of his general philosophy as
such, because he recognizes it to be false, behaves with decency only if,
in recognizing the error of his previous insight, he is prepared to draw
the ultimate consequence. In such a case he must, at the very least, renounce
the public exercise of any further political activity. For since in matters
of basic knowledge he has once succumbed to an error, there is a possibility
that this will happen a second time. And in no event does he retain the
right to continue claiming, not to mention demanding, the confidence of
his fellow citizens.How little regard is taken of such decency today is attested
by the general degeneracy of the rabble which contemporaneously feel justified
in 'going into' politics.
Hardly a one of them is fit for it.I had carefully avoided any public appearance, though I think
that I studied politics more closely than many other men. Only in the smallest
groups did I speak of the things which inwardly moved or attracted me. This
speaking in the narrowest circles had many good points: I learned to orate
less, but to know people with their opinions and objections that were often
so boundlessly primitive. And I trained myself, without losing the time
and occasion for the continuance of my own education. It is certain that
nowhere else in Germany was the opportunity for this so favorable as in
Vienna.General political thinking in the old Danubian monarchy was
just then broader and more comprehensive in scope than in old Germany, excluding
parts of Prussia, Hamburg, and the North Sea coast, at the same period.
In this case, to be sure, I understand, under the designation of 'Austria,'
that section of the great Habsburg Empire which, in consequence of its German
settlement, not only was the historic cause of the very formation of this
state, but whose population, moreover, exclusively demonstrated that power
which for so many centuries was able to give this structure, so artificial
in the political sense, its inner cultural life. As time progressed, the
existence and future of this state came to depend more and more on the preservation
of this nuclear cell of the Empire.If the old hereditary territories were the heart of the Empire
continually driving fresh blood into the circulatory stream of political
and cultural life, Vienna was the brain and will in one
Its mere outward appearance justified one in attributing to this city the
power to reign as a unifying queen amid such a conglomeration of peoples,
thus by the radiance of her own beauty causing us to forget the ugly symptoms
of old age in the structure as a whole.The Empire might quiver and quake beneath the bloody battles
of the different nationalities, yet foreigners, and especially Germans,
saw only the charming countenance of this city. Wblt made the deception
all the greater was that Vienna at that time seemed engaged in what was
perhaps its last and greatest visible revival. Under the rule of a truly
gifted mayor, the venerable residence of the Emperors of the old regime
awoke once more to a :-niraculous youth. The last great German to be born
in the ranks of the people who had colonized the Ostmark was not officially
numbered among socalled Statesmen'; but as mayor of Vienna, this capital
and imperial residence,' Dr. Lueger conjured up one amazing achievement
after another in, we may say, every field of economic and cultural municipal
politics, thereby strengthening the heart of the whole Empire, and indirectly
becoming a statesman greater than all the so-called 'diplomats' of the timeIf the conglomeration of nations called 'Austria' nevertheless
perished in the end, this does not detract in the least from the political
ability of the Germans in the old Ostmark, but was the necessary result
of the impossibility of permanently maintaining a state of fifty million
people of different nationalities by means of ten million people, unless
certain definite prerequisites were established in time.The ideas of the German-Austrian were more than grandiose.He had always been accustomed to living in a great empire and
had never lost his feeling for the tasks bound up with it. He was the only
one in this state who, beyond the narrow boundaries of the crown lands,
still saw the boundaries of the Reich; indeed, when Fate finally parted
him from the common fatherland, he kept on striving to master the gigantic
task and preserve for the German people what his fathers had once wrested
from the East in endless struggles. In this connection it should be borne
in mind that this had to be done with divided energy; for the heart and
memory of the best never ceased to feel for the common mother country, and
only a remnant was left for the homeland.The general horizon of the German-Austrian was in itself comparatively
broad. His economic connections frequently embraced almost the entire multiform
Empire. Nearly all the big business enterprises were in his hands; the directing
personnel, both technicians and officials, were in large part provided by
him. He was also in charge of foreign trade in so far as the Jews had not
laid their hands on this domain, which they have always seized for their
own. Politically, he alone held the state together. Military service alone
cast him far beyond the narrow boundaries of his homeland. The German-Austrian
recruit might join a German regiment, but the regiment itself might equally
well be in Herzegovina, Vienna, or Galicia. The officers' corps was still
German, the higher officials predominantly so. Finally, art and science
were German. Aside from the trash of the more modern artistic development,
which a nation of Negroes might just as well have produced, the German alone
possessed and disseminated a truly artistic attitude. In music, architecture,
sculpture, and painting, Vienna was the source supplying the entire dual
monarchy in inexhaustible abundance, without ever seeming to go dry itself.Finally, the Germans directed the entire foreign policy if we
disregard a small number of Hungarians.And yet any attempt to preserve this Empire was in vain, for
the most essential premise was lacking.For the Austrian state of nationalities there was only one possibility
of overcoming the centrifugal forces of the individual nations. Either the
state was centrally governed hence internally organized along the same lines.
or it was altogether inconceivable.At various lucid moments this insight dawned on the ' supreme
' authority. But as a rule it was soon forgotten or shelved as difficult
of execution. Any thought of a more federative organization of the Empire
was doomed to failure owing to the lack of a strong political germ-cell
of outstanding power. Added to this were the internal conditions of the
Austrian state which differed essentially from the German Empire of Bismarck.
In Germany it was only a question of overcoming political conditions, since
there was always a common cultural foundation. Above all, the Reich, aside
from little foreign splinters, embraced members of only one people.In Austria the opposite was the case.Here the individual provinces, aside from Hungary, lacked any
political memory of their own greatness, or it had been erased by the sponge
of time, or at least blurred and obscured. In the period when the principle
of nationalities was developing, however, national forces rose up in the
various provinces, and to counteract them was all the more difficult as
on the rim of the monarchy national states began to form whose populations,
racially equivalent or related to the Austrian national splinters, were
now able to exert a greater power of attraction than, conversely, remained
possible for the GermanAustrian.Even Vienna could not forever endure this struggle.With the development of Budapest into a big city, she had for
the first time a rival whose task was no longer to hold the entire monarchy
together, but rather to strengthen a part of it. In a short time Prague
was to follow her example, then Lemberg, Laibach, etc. With the rise of
these former provincial cities to national capitals of individual provinces,
centers formed for more or less independent cultural life in these provinces.
And only then did the politico-national instincts obtain their spiritual
foundation and depth. The time inevitably approached when these dynamic
forces of the individual peoples would grow sponger than the force of common
interests, and that would be the end of Austria.Since the death of Joseph II the course of this development
was clearly discernible. Its rapidity depended on a series of factors which
in part lay in the monarchy itself and in part were the result of the Empire's
momentary position on foreign policy.
If the fighf for the preservation of this state was to be taken up and carried
on in earnest, only a ruthless and persistent policy of centralization could
lead to the goal. First of all, the purely formal cohesion had to be emphasized
by the establishment in principle of a uniform official language, and the
administration had to be given the technical implement without which a unified
state simply cannot exist. Likewise a unified state-consciousness could
only be bred for any length of time by schools and education. This was not
feasible in ten or twenty years; it was inevitably a matter of centuries;
for in all questions of colonization, persistence assumes greater importance
than the energy of the moment.It goes without saying that the administration as well as the
political direction must be conducted with strict uniforrnity. To me it
was infinitely instructive to ascertain why this did not occur,. or rather,
why it was not done.l He who was guilty of this omission was alone to blame
for the collapse of the Empire.Old Austria more than any other state depended on the greatness
of her leaders. The foundation was lacking for a national state, which in
its national basis always possesses the power of survival, regardless how
deficient the leadership as such may be. A homogeneous national state can,
by virtue of the natural inertia of its inhabitants, and the resulting power
of resistance, sometimes withstand astonishingly long periods of the worst
administration or leadership without inwardly disintegrating. At such times
it often seems as though there were no more life in such a body, as though
it were dead and done for, but one fine day the supposed corpse suddenly
rises and gives the rest of humanity astonishing indications of its unquenchable
vital force.It is different, however, with an empire not consisting of similar
peoples, which is held together not by common blood but by a common fist.
In this case the weakness of leadership will not cause a hibernation of
the state, but an awakening of all the individual instincts which are present
in the blood, but carmot develop in times when there is a dominant will.
Only by a common education extending over centuries, by common tradition,
common interests, etc., can this danger be attenuated. Hence the younger
such state formations are, the more they depend on the greatness of leadership,
and if they are the work of outstanding soldiers and spiritual heroes, they
often crumble immediately after the death of the great solitary founder.
But even after centuries these dangers cannot be regarded as overcome; they
only lie dormant, often suddenly to awaken as soon as the weakness of the
common leadership and the force of education and all the sublime traditions
can no longer overcome the impetus of the vital urge of the individual tribes.Not to have understood this is perhaps the tragic guilt of the
House of Habsburg.For only a single one of them did Fate once again raise high
the torch over the future of his country, then it was extinguished for-ever.Joseph IIX Roman Emperor of the German nation, saw with fear
and trepidation how his House, forced to the outermost corner of the Empire,
would one day inevitably vanish in the maelstrom of a Babylon of nations
unless at the eleventh hour the omissions of his forefathers were made good.
With super-human power this 'friend of man' braced himself against the negligence
of his ancestors and endeavored to retrieve in one decade what centuries
had failed to do. If he had been granted only forty years for his work,
and if after him even two generations had continued his work as he began
it, the miracle would probably have been achieved. But when, after scarcely
ten years on the thrones worn in body and soul, he died, his work sank with
him into the grave, to awaken no more and sleep forever in the Capuchin
crypt. His successors were equal to the task neither in mind nor in will.When the first revolutionary lightnings of a new era flashed
through Europe, Austria, too, slowly began to catch fire, little by little.
But when the fire at length broke out, the flame was fanned less by social
or general political causes than by dynamic forces of national origin.The revolution of 1848 may have been a class struggle everywhere,
but in Austria it was the beginning of a new racial war. By forgetting or
not recognizing this origin and putting themselves in the service of the
revolutionary uprising, the Germans sealed their own fate. They helped to
arouse the spirit of 'Western democracy,' which in a short time removed
the foundations of their own existence.With the formation of a parliamentary representative body without
the previous establishment and crystallization of a common state language,
the cornerstone had been laid for the end of German domination of the monarchy.'
From this moment on the state itself was lost. All that followed was merely
the historic liquidation of an empire.To follow this process of dissolution was as heartrending as
it was instructive. This execution of an historical sentence was carried
out in detail in thousands and thousands of forrns. The fact that a large
part of the people moved blindly through the manifestations of decay showed
only that the gods had willed Austria's destruction.I shall not lose myself in details on this point, for that is
not the function of this book. I shall only submit to a more thoroughgoing
observation those events which are the everunchanging causes of the decline
of nations and states, thus possessing significance for our time as well,
and which ultimately contributed to securing the foundations of my own political
thinking.At the head of those institutions which could most clearly have
revealed the erosion of the Austrian monarchy, even to a shopkeeper not
otherwise gifted with sharp eyes, was one which ought to have had the greatest
strength parliament, or, as it was called in Austria, the Reichsrat.
Obviously the example of this body had been taken from England, the land
of classical 'democracy.' From there the whole blissful institution was
taken and transferred as unchanged as possible to Vienna.The English two-chamber system was solemnly resurrected in the
Abgeordnetenhaus and the Herrenhaus. Except that the houses' themselves
were somewhat different. When Barry raised his parliament buildings from
the waters of the Thames, he thrust into the history of the British Empire
and from it took the decorations for the twelve hundred niches, consoles,
and pillars of his magnificent edifice. Thus, in their sculpture and painting,
the House of Lords and the House of Commons became the nation's Hall of
Fame.This was where the first difficulty came in for Vienna. For
when Hansen, the Danish builder, had completed the last pinnacle on the
marble building of the new parliament, there was nothing he could use as
decoration except borrowings from antiquity. Roman and &reek statesmen
and philosophers now embellish this opera house of Western democracy, and
in symbolic irony the quadrigae fiy from one another in all four directions
above the two houses, in this way giving the best external expres sion of
the activities that went on inside the building.The 'nationalities' had vetoed the glorification of Austrian
history in this work as an insult and provocation, just as in the Reich
itself it was only beneath the thunder of World War battles that they dared
to dedicate Wallot's Reichstag Building to the German people by an inscription.When, not yet twenty years old, I set foot for the first time
in the magnificent building on the Franzensring to attend a session of the
House of Deputies as a spectator and listener, I was seized with the most
conflicting sentiments.I had always hated parliament, but not as an institution in
itself. On the contrary, as a freedom-loving man I could not even conceive
of any other possibility of government, for the idea of any sort of dictatorship
would, in view of my attitude toward the House of Habsburg, have seemed
to me a crime against freedom and all reason.What contributed no little to this was that as a young man,
in consequence of my extensive newspaper reading, I had, without myself
realizing it, been inoculated with a certain admiration for the British
Parliament, of which I was not easily able to rid myself. The dignity with
which the Lower House there fulfilled its tasks (as was so touchingly described
in our press) impressed me immensely. Could a people have any more exalted
form of selfgovernment?But for this very reason I was an enemy of the Austrian parliament.
I considered its whole mode of conduct unworthy of the great example. To
this the following was now added:The fate of the Germans in the Austrian state was dependent
on their position in the Reichsrat. Up to the introduction of universal
and secret suffrage, the Germans had had a majority, though an insignificant
one, in parliament. Even this condition was precarious, for the Social Democrats,
with their unreliable attitude in national questions, always turned against
German interests in critical matters affecting the Germans-in order not
to alienate the members of the various foreign nationalities. Even in those
days the Social Democracy could not be regarded as a German party. And with
the introduction of universal suffrage the German superiority ceased even
in a purely numerical sense. There was no longer any obstacle in the path
of the further de-Germanization of the state.For this reason my instinct of national self-preservation caused
me even in those days to have little love for a representative body in which
the Germans were always misrepresented rather than represented. Yet these
were deficiencies which, like so many others, were attributable, not to
the thing in itself, but to the Austrian state. I still believed that if
a German majority were restored in the representative bodies, there would
no longer be any reason for a principled opposition to them, that is, as
long as the old state continued to exist at all.These were my inner sentiments when for the first time I set
foot in these halls as hallowed as they were disputed. For me, to be sure,
they were hallowed only by the lofty beauty of the magnificent building.
A Hellenic miracle on German soil!How soon was I to grow indignant when I saw the lamentable comedy
that unfolded beneath my eyes!Present were a few hundred of these popular representatives
who had to take a position on a question of most vital economic importance.The very first day was enough to stimulate me to thought for
weeks on end.The intellectual content of what these men said was on a really
depressing level, in so far as you could understand their babbling at all;
for several of the gentlemen did not speak German, but their native Slavic
languages or rather dialects. I now had occasion to hear with my own ears
what previously I had known only from reading the newspapers. A wild gesticulating
mass screaming all at once in every different key, presided over by a goodnatured
old uncle who was striving in the sweat of his brow to revive the dignity
of the House by violently ringing his bell and alternating gentle reproofs
with grave admonitions.I couldn't help laughing.A few weeks later I was in the House again. The picture was
changed beyond recognition. The hall was absolutely empty. Down below everybody
was asleep. A few deputies were in their places, yawning at one another;
one was 'speaking.' A vicepresident of the House was present, looking into
the hall with obvious boredom.The first misgivings arose in me. From now on, whenever time
offered me the slightest opportunity, I went back and, with silence and
attention, viewed whatever picture presented itself, listened to the speeches
in so far as they were intelligible, studied the more or less intelligent
faces of the elect of the peoples of this woe-begone state-and little by
little formed my own ideas.A year of this tranquil observation sufficed totally to change
or eliminate my former view of the nature of this institution. My innermost
position was no longer against the misshapen form which this idea assumed
in Austria; no, by now I could no longer accept the parliament as such.
Up till then I had seen the misfortune of the Austrian parliament in the
absence of a German majority; now I saw that its ruination lay in the whole
nature and essence of the institution as such.A whole series of questions rose up in me.I began to make myself familiar with the democratic principle
of majority rule as the foundation of this whole institution, but devoted
no less attention to the intellectual and moral values of these gentlemen,
supposedly the elect of the nations, who were expected to serve this purpose.Thus I came to know the institution and its representatives
at once.In the course of a few years, my knowledge and insight shaped
a plastic model of that most dignified phenomenon of modern times: the parliamentarian.
He began to impress himself upon me in a form which has never since been
subjected to any essential change.Here again the visual instruction of practical reality had prevented
me from being stifled by a theory which at first sight seemed seductive
to so many, but which none the less must be counted among the symptoms of
human degeneration.The Western democracy of today is the forerunner of Marxism
which without it would not be thinkable. It provides this world plague with
the culture in which its germs can spread. In its most extreme forrn, parliamentarianism
created a 'monstrosity of excrement and fire,' in which, however, sad to
say, the 'fire' seems to me at the moment to be burned out.I must be more than thankful to Fate for laying this question
before me while I was in Vienna, for I fear that in Germany at that time
I would have found the answer too easily. For if I had first encountered
this absurd institution known as 'parliament' in Berlin, I might have fallen
into the opposite fallacy, and not without seemingly good cause have sided
with those who saw the salvation of the people and the Reich exclusively
in furthering the power of the imperial idea, and who nevertheless were
alien and blind at once to the times and the people involved.In Austria this was impossible.Here it was not so easy to go from one mistake to the other.
If parliament was worthless, the Habsburgs were even more worthless-in no
event, less so. To reject 'parliamentarianism' was not enough, for the question
still remained open: what then? The rejection and abolition of the Reichsrat
would have left the House of Habsburg the sole governing force, a thought
which, especially for me, was utterly intolerable.The difficulty of this special case led me to a more thorough
contemplation of the problem as such than would otherwise have been likely
at such tender years.What gave me most food for thought was the obvious absence of
any responsibility in a single person.The parliament arrives at some decision whose consequences may
be ever so ruinous-nobody bears any responsibility for this, no one can
be taken to account. For can it be called an acceptance of responsibility
if, after an unparalleled catastrophe, the guilty government resigns? Or
if the coalition changes, or even if parliament is itself dissolved?Can a fluctuating majority of people ever be made responsible
in any case?Isn't the very idea of responsibility bound up with the individual?
But can an individual directing a government be made practically responsible
for actions whose preparation and execution must be set exclusively to the
account of the will and inclination of a multitude of men?Or will not the task of a leading statesman be seen, not in
the birth of a creative idea or plan as such, but rather in the art of making
the brilliance of his projects intelligible to a herd of sheep and blockheads,
and subsequently begging for their kind approval?Is it the criterion of the statesman that he should possess
the art of persuasion in as high degree as that of political intelligence
in formulating great policies or decisions? Is the incapacity of a leader
shown by the fact that he does not succeed in winning for a certain idea
the majority of a mob thrown together by more or less savory accidents?Indeed, has this mob ever understood an idea before success
proclaimed its greatness?Isn't every deed of genius in this world a visible protest of
genius against the inertia of the mass?
And what should the statesman do, who does not succeed in gaining the favor
of this mob for his plans by flattery?Should he buy it?Or, in view of the stupidity of his fellow citizens, should
he renounce the execution of the tasks which he has recognized to be vital
necessities? Should he resign or should he remain at his post?
In such a case, doesn't a man of true character find himself in a hopeless
conflict between knowledge and decency, or rather honest conviction?Where is the dividing line between his duty toward the general
public and his duty toward his personal honor?Mustn't every true leader refuse to be thus degraded to the
level of a political gangster?And, conversely, mustn't every gangster feel that he is cut
out for politics, since it is never he, but some intangible mob, which has
to bear the ultimate responsibility?Mustn't our principle of parliamentary majorities lead to the
demolition of any idea of leadership?
Does anyone believe that the progress of this world springs from the mind
of majoritiesand not from the brains of individuals?Or does anyone expect that the future will be able to dispense
with this premise of human culture?Does it not, on the contrary, today seem more indispensable
than ever?By rejecting the authority of the individual and replacing it
by the numbers of some momentary mob, the parliamentary principle of majority
rule sins against the basic aristocratic principle of Nature, though it
must be said that this view is not necessarily embodied in the present-day
decadence of our upper ten thousand.The devastation caused by this institution of modern parliamentary
rule is hard for the reader of Jewish newspapers to imagine, unless he has
learned to think and examine independently. It is, first and foremost, the
cause of the incredible inundation of all political life with the most inferior,
and I mean the most inferior, characters of our time. Just as the true leader
will withdraw from all political activity which does not consist primarily
in creative achievement and work, but in bargaining and haggling for the
favor of the majority, in the same measure this activity will suit the small
mind and consequently attract it.The more dwarfish one of these present-day leathermerchants
is in spirit and ability, the more clearly his own insight makes him aware
of the lamentable figure he actually cuts-that much more will he sing the
praises of a system which does not demand of him the power and genius of
a giant, but is satisfied with the craftiness of a village mayor, preferring
in fact this kind of wisdom to that of a Pericles. And this kind doesn't
have to torment himself with responsibility for his actions. He is entirely
removed from such worry, for he well knows that, regardless what the result
of his 'statesmanlike' bungling may be, his end has long been written in
the stars: one day he will have to cede his place to another equally great
mind, for it is one of the characteristics of this decadent system that
the number of great statesmen increases in proportion as the stature of
the individual decreases With increasing dependence on parliamentary majorities
it will inevitably continue to shrink, since on the one hand great minds
will refuse to be the stooges of idiotic incompetents and bigmouths, and
on the other, conversely, the representatives of the majority, hence of
stupidity, hate nothing more passionately than a superior mind.For such an assembly of wise men of Gotham, it is always a consolation
to know that they are headed by a leader whose intelligence is at the level
of those present: this will give each one the pleasure of shining from time
to time-and, above all, if Tom can be master, what is to prevent Dick and
Harry from having their turn too?This invention of democracy is most intimately related to a
quality which in recent times has grown to be a real disgrace, to wit, the
cowardice of a great part of our so-called 'leadership. What luck to be
able to hide behind the skirts of a so-called majority in all decisions
of any real importance!Take a look at one of these political bandits. How anxiously
he begs the approval of the majority for every measure, to assure himself
of the necessary accomplices, so he can unload the responsibility at any
time. And this is one of the main reasons why this type of political activity
is always repulsive and hateful to any man who is decent at heart and hence
courageous, while it attracts all low characters-and anyone who is unwilling
to take personal responsibility for his acts, but seeks a shield, is a cowardly
scoundrel. When the leaders of a nation consist of such vile creatures,
the results will soon be deplorable. Such a nation will be unable to muster
the courage for any determined act; it will prefer to accept any dishonor,
even the most shameful, rather than rise to a decision; for there is no
one who is prepared of his own accord to pledge his person and his head
for the execution of a dauntless resolve.For there is one thing which we must never forget: in this,
too, the majority can never replace the man. It is not only a representative
of stupidity, but of cowardice as well. And no more than a hundred empty
heads make one wise man will an heroic decision arise from a hundred cowards.The less the responsibility of the individual leader, the more
numerous will be those who, despite their most insignificant stature, feel
called upon to put their immortal forces in the service of the nation. Indeed,
they will be unable to await their turn; they stand in a long line, and
with pain and regret count the number of those waiting ahead of them, calculating
almost the precise hour at which, in all probability, their turn will come.
Consequently, they long for any change in the office hovering before their
eyes, and are thankful for any scandal which thins out the ranks ahead of
them. And if some man is unwilling to move from the post he holds, this
in their eyes is practically a breach of a holy pact of solidarity. They
grow vindictive, and they do not rest until the impudent fellow is at last
overthrown, thus turning his warm place back to the public. And, rest assured,
he won't recover the position so easily. For as soon as one of these creatures
is forced to give up a position, he will try at once to wedge his way into
the 'waiting-line' unless the hue and cry raised by the others prevents
him.The consequence of all this is a terrifying turn-over in the
most important offices and positions of such a state, a result which is
always harmful, but sometimes positively catastrophic. For it is not only
the simpleton and incompetent who will fall victim to thus custom, but to
an even greater extent the real leader, if Fate somehow manages to put one
in this place. As soon as this fact has been recognized, a solid front will
form against him, especially if such a mind has not arisen from their own
ranks, but none the less dares to enter into this exalted society. For on
principle these gentry like to be among themselves and they hate as a common
enemy any brain which stands even slightly above the zeros. And in this
respect their instinct is as much sharper as it is deficient in everything
else. The result will be a steadily expanding intellectual impoverishment
of the leading circles. The result for the nation and the state, everyone
can judge for himself, excepting in so far as he himself is one of these
kind of 'leaders.' Old Austria possessed the parliamentary regime in its purest
form.To be sure, the prime ministers were always appointed by the
Emperor and King, but this very appointment was nothing halt the execution
of the parliamentary will. The haggling and bargaining for the individual
portfolios represented Western democracy of the first water. And the results
corresponded to the principles applied. Particularly the change of individual
personalities occurred in shorter and shorter terms, ultimately becoming
a veritable chase. In the same measure, the stature of the ' statesmen '
steadily diminished until finally no one remained but that type of parliamentary
gangster whose statesmanship could only be measured and recognized by their
ability in pasting together the coalitions of the moment; in other words,
concluding those pettiest of political bargains which alone demonstrate
the fitness of these representatives of the people for practical work.
Thus the Viennese school transmitted the best impressions in this field.But what attracted me no less was to compare the ability and
knowledge of these representatives of the people and the tasks which awaited
them. In this case, whether I liked it or not, I was impelled to examine
more closely the intellectual horizon of these elect of the nations themselves,
and in so doing, I could not avoid giving the necessary attention to the
processes which lead to the discovery of these ornaments of our public life.The way in which the real ability of these gentlemen was applied
and placed in the service of the fatherland-in other words, the technical
process of their activity-was also worthy of thorough study and investigation.The more determined I was to penetrate these inner conditions,
to study the personalities and material foundations with dauntless and penetrating
objectivity, the more deplorable became my total picture of parliamentary
life. Indeed, this is an advisable procedure in dealing with an institution
which, in the person of its representatives, feels obliged to bring up '
objectivity ' in every second sentence as the only proper basis for every
investigation and opinion. Investigate these gentlemen themselves and the
laws of their sordid existence, and you will be amazed at the result.There is no principle which, objectively considered, is as false
a,s that of parliamentarianism.Here we may totally disregard the manner in which our fine representatives
of the people are chosen, how they arrive at their office and their new
dignity. That only the tiniest fraction of them rise in fulfillment of a
general desire, let alone a need, will at once be apparent to anyone who
realizes that the political understanding of the broad masses is far from
being highly enough developed to arrive at definite general political views
of their own accord and seek out the suitable personalities.The thing we designate by the word 'public opinion' rests only
in the smallest part on experience or knowledge which the individual has
acquired by hirnself, but rather on an idea which is inspired by so-called
'enlightenment,' often of a highly persistent and obtrusive type.Just as a man's denominational orientation is the result of
upbringing, and only the religious need as such slumbers in his soul, the
political opinion of the masses represents nothing but the final result
of an incredibly tenacious and thorough manipulation of their mind and soul.
By far the greatest share in their political 'education,' which in this
case is most aptly designated by the word 'propaganda,' falls to the account
of the press. It is foremost in performing this 'work of enlightenment'
and thus represents a sort of school for grown-ups. This instruction, however,
is not in the hands of the state, but in the claws of forces which are in
part very inferior. In Vienna as a very young man I had the best opportunity
to become acquainted with the owners and spiritual manufacturers of this
machine for educating the masses. At first I could not help but be amazed
at how short a time it took this great evil power within the state to create
a certain opinion even where it meant totally falsifying profound desires
and views which surely existed among the public. In a few days a ridiculous
episode had become a significant state action, while, conversely, at the
same time, vital problems fell a prey to public oblivion, or rather were
simply filched from the memory and consciousness of the masses.Thus, in the course of a few weeks it was possible to conjure
up names out of the void, to associate them with incredible hopes on the
part of the broad public, even to give them a popularity which the really
great man often does not obtain his whole life long; names which a month
before no one had even seen or heard of, while at the same time old and
proved figures of political or other public life, though in the best of
health, simply died as far as their fellow men were concemed, or were heaped
with such vile insults that their names soon threatened to become the symbol
of some definite act of infamy or villainy. We must study this vile Jewish
technique of emptying garbage pails full of the vilest slanders and defamations
from hundreds and hundreds of sources at once, suddenly and as if by magic,
on the clean garments of honorable men, if we are fully to appreciate the
entire menace represented by these scoundrels of the press.There is absolutely nothing one of these spiritual robberbarons
will not do to achieve his savory aims.He will poke into the most secret family affairs and not rest
until his trufRe-searching instinct digs up some miserable incident which
is calculated to finish off the unfortunate victim. But if, after the most
careful sniffing, absolutely nothing is found, either in the man's public
or private life, one of these scoundrels simply seizes on slander, in the
firm conviction that despite a thousand refutations something always sticks
and, moreover, through the immediate and hundredfold repetition of his defamations
by all his accomplices, any resistance on the part of the victim is in most
cases utterly impossible; and it must be borne in mind that this rabble
never acts out of motives which might seem credible or even understandable
to the rest of humanity. God forbid! While one of these scum is attacking
his beloved fellow men in the most contemptible fashion, the octopus covers
himself with a veritable cloud of respectability and unctuous phrases, prates
about ' journalistic duty ' and suchlike lies, and even goes so far as to
shoot off his mouth at committee meetings and congresses- that is, occasions
where these pests are present in large numbers -about a very special variety
of 'honor,' to wit, the journalistic variety, which the assembled rabble
gravely and mutually confirm.These scum manufacture more than three quarters of the so-called
'public opinion,' from whose foam the parliamentarian Aphrodite arises.
To give an accurate description of this process and depict it in all its
falsehood and improbability, one would have to write volumes. But even if
we disregard all this and examine only the given product along with its
activity, this seems to me enough to make the objective lunacy of this institution
dawn on even the naivest mind.This human error, as senseless as it is dangerous, will most
readily be understood as soon as we compare democratic parliamentarianism
with a truly Germanic democracy.The distinguishing feature of the former is that a body of,
let us say five hundred men, or in recent times even women, is chosen and
entrusted with making the ultimate decision in any and all matters. And
so for practical purposes they alone are the government; for even if they
do choose a cabinet which undertakes the external direction of the affairs
of state, this is a mere sham. In reality this so-called government cannot
take a step without first obtaining the approval of the general assembly.
Consequently, it cannot be made responsible for anything, since the ultimate
decision never lies with it, but with the majority of parliament. In every
case it does nothing but carry out the momentary will of the majority. Its
political ability can only be judged according to the skill with which it
understands how either to adapt itself to the will of the majority or to
pull the majority over to its side. Thereby it sinks from the heights of
real government to the level of a beggar confronting the momentary majority.
Indeed, its most urgent task becomes nothing more than either to secure
the favor of the existing majority, as the need arises, or to form a majority
with more friendly inclinations. If this succeeds, it may 'govern' a little
while longer; if it doesn't succeed, it can resign. The soundness of its
purposes as such is beside the point.For practical purposes, this excludes all responsibilityTo what consequences this leads can be seen from a few simple
considerations:The internal composition of the five hundred chosen representatives
of the people, with regard to profession or even individual abilities, gives
a picture as incoherent as it is usually deplorable. For no one can believe
that these men elected by the nation are elect of spirit or even of intelligence
! It is to be hoped that no one will suppose that the ballots of an electorate
which is anything else than brilliant will give rise to statesmen by the
hundreds. Altogether we cannot be too sharp in condemning the absurd notion
that geniuses can be born from general elections. In the first place, a
nation only produces a real statesman once in a blue moon and not a hundred
or more at once; and in the second place, the revulsion of the masses for
every outstanding genius is positively instinctive. Sooner will a camel
pass through a needle's eye than a great man be ' discovered' by an election.
In world history the man who really rises above the norm of the broad average
usually announces himself personally.As it is, however, five hundred men, whose stature is to say
the least modest, vote on the most important affairs of the nation, appoint
governments which in every single case and in every special question have
to get the approval of the exalted assembly, so that policy is really made
by five hundred.And that is just what it usually looks like.But even leaving the genius of these representatives of the
people aside, bear in mind how varied are the problems awaiting attention,
in what widely removed fields solutions and decisions must be made, and
you will realize how inadequate a governing institution must be which transfers
the ultimate right of decision to a mass assembly of people, only a tiny
fraction of which possess knowledge and experience of the matter to be treated.
The most important economic measures are thus submitted to a forum, only
a tenth of whose members have any economic education to show. This is nothing
more nor less than placing the ultimate decision in a matter in the hands
of men totally lacking in every prerequisite for the task.The same is true of every other question. The decision is always
made by a majority of ignoramuses and incompetents, since the composition
of this institution remains unchanged while the problems under treatment
extend to nearly every province of public life and would thereby presuppose
a constant turn-over in the deputies who are to judge and decide on them,
since it is impossible to let the same persons decide matters of transportation
as, let us say, a question of high for eign policy. Otherwise these men
would all have to be universal geniuses such as we actually seldom encounter
once in centuries. Unfortunately we are here confronted, for the most part,
not with 'thinkers,' but with dilettantes as limited as they are conceited
and infiated, intellectual demimonde of the worst sort. And this is the
source of the often incomprehensible frivolity with which these gentry speak
and decide on things which would require careful meditation even in the
greatest minds. Measures of the gravest significance for the future of a
whole state, yes, of a nation, are passed as though a game of schafDopf
or tarock,l which would certainly be better suited to their abilities, lay
on the table before them and not the fate of a race.Yet it would surely be unjust to believe that all of the deputies
in such a parliament were personally endowed with so little sense of responsibility.No, by no means.But by forcing the individual to take a position on such questions
completely ill-suited to him, this system gradually ruins hus character.
No one will summon up the courage to declare: Gentlemen, I believe we understand
nothing about this matter I personally certainly do not.' (Besides, this
would change mat ters little, for surely this kind of honesty would remain
totally unappreciated, and what is more, our friends would scarcely allow
one honorable jackass to spoil their whole game.) Anyone with a knowledge
of people will realize that in such an illustrious company no one is eager
to be the stupidest, and in certain circles honesty is almost synonymous
with stupidityThus, even the representative who at first was honest is thrown
end page 89
Page 90
into this track of general falsehood and deceit. The very conviction that
the non-participation of an individual in the business would in itself change
nothing kills every honorable impulse which may rise up in this or that
deputy. And finally, moreover, he may tell himself that he personally is
far from being the worst among the others, and that the sole effect of his
collaboration is perhaps to prevent worse things from happening. It will be objected, to be sure, that. though the individual
deputy possesses no special understanding in this or that matter, his position
has been discussed by the fraction which directs the policy of the gentleman
in question, and that the fraction has its special committees which are
more than adequately enlightened by experts anyway. At first glance this seems to be true. But then the question
arises: Why are five hundred chosen when only a few possess the necessary
wisdom to take a position in the most important matters?And this is the worm in the apple!It is not the aim of our present-day parliamentarianism to constitute
an assembly of wise men, but rather to compose a band of mentally dependent
nonentities who are the more easily led in certain directions, the greater
is the personal limitation of the individual. That is the only way of carrying
on party politics in the malodorous present-day sense. And only in this
way is it possible for the real wirepuller to remain carefully in the background
and never personally be called to responsibility. For then every decision,
regardless how harmful to the nation, will not be set to the account of
a scoundrel visible to all, but will be unloaded on the shoulders of a whole
fraction.And thereby every practical responsibility vanishes. For responsibility
can lie only in the obligation of an individual and not in a parliamentary
bull session.Such an institution can only please the biggest liars and sneaks
of the sort that shun the light of day, because it is inevitably hateful
to an honorable, straightforward man who welcomes personal responsibility.And that is why this type of democracy has become the instrument
of that race which in its inner goals must shun the light of day, now and
in all ages of the future. Only the Jew can praise an institution which
is as dirty and false as he himself.Juxtaposed to this is the truly Germanic democracy characterized
by the free election of a leader and his obligation fully to assume all
responsibility for his actions and omissions. In it there is no majority
vote on individual questions, but only the decision of an individual who
must answer with his fortune and his life for his choice.If it be objected that under such conditions scarcely anyone
would be prepared to dedicate his person to so risky a task, there is but
one possible answer:Thank the Lord, Germanic democracy means just this: that any
old climber or moral slacker cannot rise by devious paths to govern his
national comrades, but that, by the very greatness of the responsibility
to be assumed, incompetents and weaklings are frightened off. But if, nevertheless, one of these scoundrels should attempt
to sneak in, we can find him more easily, and mercilessly challenge him:
Out, cowardly scoundrel! Remove your foot, you are besmirching the steps;
the front steps of the Pantheon of history are not for sneak-thieves, but
for heroes!I had fought my way to this conclusion after two years attendance
at the Vienna parliament.After that I never went back.The parliamentary regime shared the chief blame for the weakness,
constantly increasing in the past few years, of the Habsburg state. The
more its activities broke the predominance of the Germans, the more the
country succumbed to a system of playing off the nationalities against one
another. In the Reichsrat itself this was always done at the expense of
the Germans and thereby, in the last analysis, at the expense of the Empire;
for by the turn of the century it must have been apparent even to the simplest
that the monarchy's force of attraction would no longer be able to withstand
the separatist tendencies of the provinces. On the contrary.The more pathetic became the means which the state had to employ
for its preservation, the more the general contempt for it increased. Not
only in Hungary, but also in the separate Slavic provinces, people began
to identify themselves so little with the common monarchy that they did
not regard its weakness as their own disgrace. On the contrary, they rejoiced
at such symptoms of old age; for they hoped more for the Empire's death
than for its recovery.In parliament, for the moment, total collapse was averted by
undignified submissiveness and acquiescence at every extortion, for which
the German had to pay in the end; and in the country, by most skillfully
playing off the different peoples against each other. But the general line
of development was nevertheless directed against the Germans. Especially
since Archduke Francis Ferdinand became heir apparent and began to enjoy
a certain influence, there began to be some plan and order in the policy
of Czechization from above. With all possible means, this future ruler of
the dual monarchy tried to encourage a policy of deGermanization, to advance
it himself or at least to sanction it. Purely German towns, indirectly through
government official dom, were slowly but steadily pushed into the mixed-language
danger zones. Even in Lower Austria this process began to make increasingly
rapid progress, and many Czechs considered Vienna their largest city.The central idea of this new Habsburg, whose family had ceased
to speak anything but Czech (the Archduke's wife, a former Czech countess,
had been morganatically married to the Prince-she came from circles whose
anti-German attitude was traditional), was gradually to establish a Slavic
state in Central Europe which for defense against Orthodox Russia should
be placed on a strictly Catholic basis. Thus, as the Habsburgs had so often
done before, religion was once again put into the service of a purely political
idea, and what was worse-at least from the German viewpoint-of a catastrophic
idea.The result was more than dismal in many respects. Neither the
House of Habsburg nor the Catholic Church received the expected reward.Habsburg lost the throne, Rome a great state.For by employing religious forces in the service of its political
considerations, the crown aroused a spirit which at the outset it had not
considered possible.In answer to the attempt to exterminate the Germans in the old
monarchy by every possible means, there arose the PanGerman movement in
Austria. By the eighties the basic Jewish tendency of Manchester liberalism
had reached, if not passed, its high point in the monarchy. The reaction
to it, however, as with everything in old Austria, arose primarily from
a social, not from a national standpoint. The instinct of self-preservation
forced the Germans to adopt the sharpest measures of defense. Only secondarily
did economic considerations begin to assume a decisive influence. And so,
two party formations grew out of the general political confusion, the one
with the more national, the other with the more social, attitude, but both
highly interesting and instructive for the future. After the depressing end of the War of 1866, the House of Habsburg
harbored the idea of revenge on the battlefield. Only the death of Emperor
Max of Mexico, whose unfortunate expedition was blamed primarily on Napoleon
III and whose abandonment by the French aroused general indignation, prevented
a closer collaboration with France. Habsburg nevertheless lurked in wait.
If the War of 1870-71 had not been so unique a triumph, the Vienna Court
would probably have risked a bloody venture to avenge Sadowa. But when the
first amazing and scarcely credible, but none the less true, tales of heroism
arrived from the battlefields, the 'wisest' of all monarchs recognized that
the hour was not propitious and put the best possible face on a bad business.But the heroic struggle of these years had accomplished an even
mightier miracle; for with the Habsburgs a change of position never arose
from the urge of the innermost heart, but from the compulsion of circumstances.
However, the German people of the old Ostmark were swept along by the Reich's
frenzy of victory, and looked on with deep emotion as the dream of their
fathers was resurrected to glorious reality.For make no mistake: the truly German-minded Austrian had, even
at Koniggratz, and from this time on, recognized the tragic but necessary
prerequisite for the resurrection of a Reich which would no longer be-and
actually was not-afflicted with the foul morass of the old Union. Above
all, he had come to understand thoroughly, by his own suffering, that the
House of Habsburg had at last concluded its historical mission and that
the new Reich could choose as Emperor only him whose heroic convictions
made him worthy to bear the 'Crown of the Rhine.' But how much more was
Fate to be praised for accomplishing this investiture in the scion of a
house which in Frederick the Great had given the nation a gleaming and eternal
symbol of its resurrection.But when after the great war the House of Habsburg began with
desperate determination slowly but inexorably to exterminate the dangerous
German element in the dual monarchy (the inner convictions of this element
could not be held in doubt), for such would be the inevitable result of
the Slavization policy- the doomed people rose to a resistance such as modern
German history had never seen.For the first time, men of national and patriotic mind became
rebels.Rebels, not against the nation and not against the state as
such, but rebels against a kind of government which in their conviction
would inevitably lead to the destruction of their own nationality.For the first time in modern German history, traditional dynastic
patriotism parted ways with the national love of fatherland and people.The Pan-German movement in German-Austria in the nineties is
to be praised for demonstrating in clear, unmistakable terms that a state
authority is entitled to demand respect and protection only when it meets
the interests of a people, or at least does not harm them.There can be no such thing as state authority as an end in itself,
for, if there were, every tyranny in this world would be unassailable and
sacred.If, by the instrument of governmental power, a nationality is
led toward its destruction, then rebellion is not only the right of every
member of such a people-it is his duty.And the question-when is this the case?-is decided not by theoretical
dissertations, but by force and-results.Since, as a matter of course, all governmental power claims
the duty of preserving state authority-regardless how vicious it is, betraying
the interests of a people a thousandfold-the national instinct of self-preservation,
in overthrowing such a power and achieving freedom or independence, will
have to employ the same weapons by means of which the enemy tries to maintain
his power. Consequently, the struggle will be carried on with 'legal' means
as long as the power to be overthrown employs such means; but it will not
shun illegal means if the oppressor uses them.In general it should not be forgotten that the highest aim of
human existence is not the preservation of a state, let alone a government,
but the preservation of the species.And if the species itself is in danger of being oppressed or
utterly eliminated, the question of legality is reduced to a subordinate
role. Then, even if the methods of the ruling power are alleged to be legal
a thousand times over, nonetheless the oppressed people's instinct of self-preservation
remains the loftiest justification of their struggle with every weapon.Only through recognition of this principle have wars of liberation
against internal and external enslavement of nations on this earth come
down to us in such majestic historical examples.Human law cancels out state law.And if a people is defeated in its struggle for human rights,
this merely means that it has been found too light in the scale of destiny
for the happiness of survival on this earth. For when a people is not willing
or able to fight for its existence- Providence in its eternal justice has
decreed that people's end.The world is not for cowardly peoples.How easy it is for a tyranny to cover itself with the cloak
of so-called 'legality' is shown most clearly and penetratingly by the example
of Austria.The legal state power in those days was rooted in the antiGerman
soil of parliament with its non-German majorities- and in the equally anti-German
ruling house. In these two factors the entire state authority was embodied.
Any attempt to change the destinies of the German-Austrian people from this
position was absurd. Hence, in the opinions of our friends the worshipers
of state authority as such and of the 'legal' way, all resistance would
have had to be shunned, as incompatible with legal methods. But this, with
compelling necessity, would have meant the end of the German people in the
monarchy-and in a very short time. And, as a matter of fact, the Germans
were saved from this fate only by the collapse of this state.The bespectacled theoretician, it is true, would still prefer
to die for his doctrine than for his people.Since it is men who make the laws, he believes that they live
for the sake of these laws.The Pan-German movement in Austria had the merit of completely
doing away with this nonsense, to the horror of all theoretical pedants
and other fetish-worshiping isolationists in the government.Since the Habsburgs attempted to attack Germanism with all possible
means, this party attacked the 'exalted' ruling house itself, and without
mercy. For the first time it probed into this rotten state and opened the
eyes of hundreds of thousands. To its credit be it said that it released
the glorious concept of love of fatherland from the embrace of this sorry
dynasty.In the early days of its appearance, its following was extremely
great, threatening to become a veritable avalanche. But the success did
not last. When I came to Vienna, the movement had long been overshadowed
by the Christian Social Party which had meanwhile attained power-and had
indeed been reduced to almost complete insignificance.This whole process of the growth and passing of the Pan-German
movement on the one hand, and the unprecedented rise of the Christian Social
Party on the other, was to assume the deepest significance for me as a classical
object of study.When I came to Vienna, my sympathies were fully and wholly on
the side of the Pan-German tendency.That they mustered the courage to cry 'Loch Hohenzollern' impressed
me as much as it pleased me; that they still regarded themselves as an only
temporarily severed part of the German Reich, and never let a moment pass
without openly attesting this fact, inspired me with joyful confidence;
that in all questions regarding Germanism they showed their colors without
reserve, and never descended to compromises, seemed to me the one still
passable road to the salvation of our people; and I could not understand
how after its so magnificent rise the movement should have taken such a
sharp decline. Even less could I understand how the Christian Social Party
at this same period could achieve such immense power. At that time it had
just reached the apogee of its glory.As I set about comparing these movements, Fate, accelerated
by my otherwise sad situation, gave me the best instruction for an understanding
of the causes of this riddle.I shall begin my comparisons with the two men who may be regarded
as the leaders and founders of the two parties: Georg von Schonerer and
Dr. Karl Lueger.From a purely human standpoint they both tower far above the
scope and stature of so-called parliamentary figures. Amid the morass of
general political corruption their whole life remained pure and unassailable.
Nevertheless my personal sympathy lay at first on the side of the Pan-German
Schonerer, and turned only little by little toward the Christian Social
leader as well.Compared as to abilities, Schonerer seemed to me even then the
better and more profound thinker in questions of principle. He foresaw the
inevitable end of the Austrian state more clearly and correctly than anyone
else. If, especially in the Reich, people had paid more attention to his
warnings
against the Habsburg monarchy, the calamity of Germany's World War against
all Europe would never have occurred.But if Schonerer recognized the problems in their innermost
essence, he erred when it came to men.Here, on the other hand, lay Dr. Lueger's strength.He had a rare knowledge of men and in particular took good care
not to consider people better than they are. Consequently, he reckoned more
with the real possibilities of life while Schonerer had but little understanding
for them. Theoretically speaking, all the Pan-German's thoughts were correct,
but since he lacked the force and astuteness to transmit his theoretical
knowledge to the masses-that is, to put it in a form suited to the receptivity
of the broad masses, which is and remains exceedingly limited-all his knowledge
was visionary wisdom, and could never become practical reality.And this lack of actual knowledge of men led in the course of
time to an error in estimating the strength of whole movements as well as
age-old institutions.Finally, Schonerer realized, to be sure, that questions of basic
philosophy were involved, but he did not understand that only the broad
masses of a people are primarily able to uphold such well-nigh religious
convictions.Unfortunately, he saw only to a limited extent the extra-ordinary
limitation of the will to fight in so-called 'bourgeois' circles, due, if
nothing else, to their economic position which makes the individual fear
to lose too much and thereby holds him in check.And yet, on the whole, a philosophy can hope for victory only
if the broad masses adhere to the new doctrine and declare their readiness
to undertake the necessary struggle.From this deficient understanding of the importance of the lower
strata of the people arose a completely inadequate con-ception of the social
question.In all this Dr. Lueger was the opposite of Schonerer.His thorough knowledge of men enabled him to judge the possible
forces correctly, at the same time preserving him from underestimating existing
institutions, and perhaps for this very reason taught him to make use of
these institutions as instruments for the achievement of his purposes.
He understood only too well that the political fighting power of the upper
bourgeoisie at the present time was but slight and inadequate for achieving
the victory of a great movement. He therefore laid the greatest stress in
his political activity on winning over the classes whose existence was threatened
and therefore tended to spur rather than paralyze the will to fight. Likewise
he was inclined to make use of all existing implements of power, to incline
mighty existing institutions in his favor, drawing from these old sources
of power the greatest possible profit for his own movement.Thus he adjusted his new party primarily to the middle class
menaced with destruction, and thereby assured himself of a following that
was difficult to shake, whose spirit of sacrifice was as great as its fighting
power. His policy toward the Catholic Church, fashioned with infinite shrewdness,
in a short time won over the younger clergy to such an extent that the old
Clerical Party was forced either to abandon the field, or, more wisely,
to join the new party, in order slowly to recover position after position.To take this alone as the characteristic essence of the man
would be to do him a grave injustice. For in addition to being an astute
tactician, he had the qualities of a truly great and brilliant reformer:
though here, too, he observed the limits set by a precise knowledge of the
existing possibilities as well as his own personal abilities.It was an infinitely practical goal that this truly significant
man had set himself. He wanted to conquer Vienna. Vienna was the heart of
the monarchy; from this city the last flush of life flowed out into the
sickly, old body of the crumbling empire. The healthier the heart became,
the more the rest of the body was bound to revive: an idea, correct in principle,
but which could be applied only for a certain limited time.And herein lay this man's weakness.What he had done as mayor of Vienna is immortal in the best
sense of the word; but he could no longer save the monarchy, it was too
late.His opponent, Schonerer, had seen this more clearlyAll Dr. Lueger's practical efforts were amazingly successfulthe
hopes he based on them were not realized.Schonerer's efforts were not successful, but his most terrible
fears came true.Thus neither man realized his ultimate goal. Lueger could no
longer save Austria, and Schonerer could no longer save the German people
from ruin.It is infinitely instructive for our present day to study the
causes for the failure of both parties. This is particularly useful for
my friends, since in many points conditions today are similar to then and
errors can thereby be avoided which at that time caused the end of the one
movement and the sterility of the other.To my mind, there were three causes for the collapse of the
Pan-German movement in Austria.In the first place, its unclear conception of the significance
of the social problem, especially for a new and essentially revolutionary
party. Since Schonerer and his followers addressed themselves principally
to bourgeois circles, the result was bound to be very feeble and tame.Though some people fail to suspect it, the German bourgeoisie,
especially in its upper circles, is pacifistic to the point of positive
self-abnegation, where internal affairs of the nation or state are concerned.
In good times that is, in this case, in times of good government such an
attitude makes these classes extremely valuable to the state; but in times
of an inferior regime it is positively ruinous. To make possible the waging
of any really serious struggle, the Pan-German movement should above all
have dedicated itself to winning the masses. That it failed to do so deprived
it in advance of the elemental impetus which a wave of its kind simply must
have if it is not in a short time to ebb away. Unless this principle is borne in mind and carried out from
the very start, the new party loses all possibility of later making up for
what has been lost. For, by the admission of numerous moderate bourgeois
elements, the basic attitude of the movement will always be governed by
them and thus lose any further prospect of winning appreciable forces from
the broad masses. As a result, such a movement will not rise above mere
grumbling and criticizing. The faith bordering more or less on religion,
combined with a similar spirit of sacrifice, will cease to exist; in its
place will arise an effort gradually to grind off the edges of struggle
by means of 'positive' collaboration; that is, in this case, by acceptance
of the existing order, thus ultimately leading to a putrid peace.And this is what happened to the Pan-German movement because
it had not from the outset laid its chief stress on winning supporters from
the circles of the great masses. It achieved 'bourgeois respectability and
a muffled radicalism.'From this error arose the second cause of its rapid decline.At the time of the emergence of the Pan-German movement the
situation of the Germans in Austria was already desperate. From year to
year the parliament had increasingly become an institution for the slow
destruction of the German people. Any attempt at salvation in the eleventh
hour could offer even the slightest hope of success only if this institution
were eliminated.Thus the movement was faced with a question of basic importance:Should its members, to destroy parliament, go into parliament,
in order, as people used to say, 'to bore from within,' or should they carry
on the struggle from outside by an attack on this institution as such?They went in and they came out defeated.To be sure, they couldn't help but go in.To carry on the struggle against such a power from outside means
to arm with unflinching courage and to be prepared for endless sacrifices.
You seize the bull by the horns, you suffer many heavy blows, you are sometimes
thrown to the earth, sometimes you get up with broken limbs, and only after
the hardest contest does victory reward the bold assailant. Only the greatness
of the sacrifices will win new fighters for the cause, until at last tenacity
is rewarded by success.But for this the sons of the broad masses are required.They alone are determined and tough enough to carry through
the fight to its bloody end.And the Pan-German movement did not possess these broad masses;
thus no course remained open but to go into parliamentIt would be a mistake to believe that this decision was the
result of long soul torments, or even meditations; no, no other idea entered
their heads. Participation in this absurdity was only the
sediment resulting from general, unclear conceptions regarding the significance
and effect of such a participation in an institution which had in principle
been recognized as false. In general, the
party hoped that this would facilitate the enlightenment of the broad masses,
since it would now have an opportunity to speak before the 'forum of the
whole nation.' Besides, it seemed plausible that attacking the root of the
evil was bound to be more successful than storming it from outside. They
thought the security of the individual fighter was increased by the protection
of parliamentary immunity, and that this could only enhance the force of
the attack. In reality, it must be said, things turned out very differently.The forum before which the Pan-German deputies spoke had not
become greater but smaller; for each man speaks only to the circle which
can hear him, or which obtains an account of his words in the newspapers.And, not the halls of parliament, but the great public meeting,
represents the largest direct forum of listeners.For, in the latter, there are thousands of people who have come
only to hear what the speaker has to say to them, while in the halls of
parliament there are only a few hundreds, and most of these are present
only to collect their attendance fees, and cer-tainly not to be illuminated
by the wisdom of this or that fellow 'representative of the people.'And above all:This is always the same public, which will never learn anything
new, since, aside from the intelligence, it is lacking in the very rudiments
of will.Never will one of these representatives of the people honor
a superior truth of his own accord, and place himself in its service.No, this is something that not a single one of them will do
unless he has reason to hope that by such a shift he may save his mandate
for one more session. Only when it is in the air that the party in power
will come off badly in a coming election, will these ornaments of virility
shift to a party or tendency which they presume will come out better, though
you may be confident that this change of position usually occurs amidst
a cloudburst of moral justifications. Consequently, when an existing party
appears to be falling beneath the disfavor of the people to such an extent
that the probability of an annihilating defeat threatens, such a great shift
will always begin: then the parliamentary rats leave the party ship.All this has nothing to do with better knowledge or intentions,
but only with that prophetic gift which warns these parliamentary bedbugs
at the right moment and causes them to drop, again and again, into another
warm party bed.But to speak to such a 'forum' is really to cast pearls before
the well-known domestic beasts. It is truly not worth while. The result
can be nothing but zero.And that is just what it was.The Pan-German deputies could talk their throats hoarse: the
effect was practically nil.The press either killed them with silence or mutilated their
speeches in such a way that any coherence, and often even the sense, was
twisted or entirely lost, and public opinion received a very poor picture
of the aims of the new movement. What the various gentlemen said was quite
unimportant; the important thing was what people read about them. And this
was an extract from their speeches, so disjointed that it could-as intended-
only seem absurd. The only forum to which they really spoke consisted of
five hundred parliamentarians, and that is enough said.But the worst was the following:The Pan-German movement could count on success only if it realized
from the very first day that what was required was not a new party, but
a new philosophy. Only the latter could produce the inward power to fight
this gigantic struggle to its end. And for this, only the very best and
courageous minds can serve as leaders.If the struggle for a philosophy is not lead by heroes prepared
to make sacrifices, there will, in a short time, cease to be any warriors
willing to die. The man who is fighting for his own existence cannot have
much left over for the community.In order to maintain this requirement, every man must know that
the new movement can offer the present nothing but honor and fame in posterity.
The more easily attainable posts and offices a movement has to hand out,
the more inferior stuff it will attract, and in the end these political
hangers-on overwhelm a successful party in such number that the honest fighter
of former days no longer recognizes the old movement and the new arrivals
definitely reject him as an unwelcome intruder. When this happens, the 'mission'
of such a movement is done for.As soon as the Pan-German movement sold its soul to parlia-ment,
it attracted 'parliamentarians' instead of leaders and fighters.Thus it sank to the level of the ordinary political parties
of the day and lost the strength to oppose a catastrophic destiny with the
defiance of martyrdom. Instead of fighting, it now learned to
make speeches and 'negotiate.' And in a short time the new parliamentarian
found it a more attractive, because less dangerous, duty to fight for the
new philosophy with the 'spiritual' weapons of parliamentary eloquence,
than to risk his own life, if necessary, by throwing himself into a struggle
whose issue was uncertain and which in any case could bring him no profit.Once they had members in parliament, the supporters outside
began to hope and wait for miracles which, of course, did not occur and
could not occur. For this reason they soon became impatient, for even what
they heard from their own deputies was by no means up to the expectations
of the voters. This was perfectly natural, since the hostile press took
good care not to give the people any faithful picture of the work of the
Pan-German deputies.The more the new representatives of the people developed a taste
for the somewhat gentler variety of 'revolutionary' struggle in parliament
and the provincial diets, the less prepared they were to return to the more
dangerous work of enlightening the broad masses of the people. The mass
meeting, the only way to exert a truly effective, because personal, influence
on large sections of the people and thus possibly to win them, was thrust
more and more into the background.Once the platform of parliament was definitely substituted for
the beer table of the meeting hall, and from this forum speeches were poured,
not into the people, but on the heads of their so called 'elect,' the Pan-German
movement ceased to be a movement of the people and in a short time dwindled
into an academic discussion club to be taken more or less seriously.Consequently, the bad impression transmitted by the press was
in no way corrected by personal agitation at meetings by the individual
gentlemen, with the result that finally the word 'PanGerman' began to have
a very bad sound in the ears of the broad masses.For let it be said to all our present-day fops and knights of
the pen: the greatest revolutions in this world have never been directed
by a goose-quill!No, to the pen it has always been reserved to provide their
theoretical foundations.But the power which has always started the greatest religious
and political avalanches in history rolling has from time immemorial been
the magic power of the spoken word, and that alone.Particularly the broad masses of the people can be moved only
by the power of speech. And all great movements are popular movements, volcanic
eruptions of human passions and emotional sentiments, stirred either by
the cruel Goddess of Distress or by the firebrand of the word hurled among
the masses; they are not the lemonade-like outpourings of literary aesthetes
and drawingroom heroes.Only a storm of hot passion can turn the destinies of peoples,
and he alone can arouse passion who bears it within himself.It alone gives its chosen one the words which like hammer blows
can open the gates to the heart of a people.But the man whom passion fails and whose lips are sealed- he
has not been chosen by Heaven to proclaim its will.Therefore, let the writer remain by his ink-well, engaging in
'theoretical' activity, if his intelligence and ability are equal to it;
for leadership he is neither born nor chosen.A movement with great aims must therefore be anxiously on its
guard not to lose contact with the broad masses.It must examine every question primarily from this standpoint
and make its decisions accordingly.It must, furthermore, avoid everything which might diminish
or even weaken its ability to move the masses, not for 'demagogic' reasons,
but in the simple knowledge that without the mighty force of the mass of
a people, no great idea, however lofty and noble it may seem, can be realized.Hard reality alone must determine the road to the goal; unwillingness
to travel unpleasant roads only too often in this world means to renounce
the goal; which may or may not be what you want.As soon as the Pan-German movement by its parliamentary attitude
had shifted the weight of its activity to parliament instead of the people,
it lost the future and instead won cheap successes of the moment.It chose the easier struggle and thereby became unworthy of
ultimate victory.Even in Vienna I pondered this very question with the greatest
care, and in the failure to recognize it saw one of the main causes of the
collapse of the movement which in those days, in my opinion, was predestined
to undertake the leadership of the German element.The first two mistakes which caused the Pan-German movement
to founder were related to each other. Insufficient knowledge of the inner
driving forces of great revolutions led to an insufficient estimation of
the importance of the broad masses of the people; from this resulted its
insufficient interest in the social question, its deficient and inadequate
efforts to win the soul of the lower classes of the nation, as well as its
over-favorable attitude toward parliament.If they had recognized the tremendous power which at all times
must be attributed to the masses as the repository of revolutionary resistance,
they would have worked differently in social and propagandist matters. Then
the movement's center of gravity would not have been shifted to parliament,
but to the workshop and the street.Likewise the third error finds its ultimate germ in failure
to recognize the value of the masses, which, it is true, need superior minds
to set them in motion in a given direction, but which then, like a flywheel,
lend the force of the attack momentum and uniform persistence.The hard struggle which the Pan-germans fought with the Catholic
Church can be accounted for only by their insufficient understanding of
the spiritual nature of the people.The causes for the new party's violent attack on Rome were as
follows:As soon as the House of Habsburg had definitely made up its
mind to reshape Austria into a Slavic state, it seized upon every means
which seemed in any way suited to this tendency. Even religious institutions
were, without the
slightest qualms, harnessed to the service of the new ' state idea ' by
this unscrupulous ruling house.The use of Czech pastorates and their spiritual shepherds was
but one of the many means of attaining this goal, a general Slavization
of Austria. The process took approximately the following form:Czech pastors were appointed to German communities; slowly but
surely they began to set the interests of the Czech people above the interests
of the churches, becoming germ-cells of the de-Germanization process. The German clergy did practically nothing to counter these methods.
Not only were they completely useless for carrying on this struggle in a
positive German sense; they were even unable to oppose the necessary resistance
to the attacks of the adversary. Indirectly, by the misuse of religion on
the one hand, and owing to insufficient defense on the other, Germanism
was slowly but steadily forced back.If in small matters the situation was as described, in big things,
unfortunately, it was not far different.Here, too, the anti-German efforts of the Habsburgs did not
encounter the resistance they should have, especially on the part of the
high clergy, while the defense of German interests sank completely into
the background.The general impression could only be that the Catholic clergy
as such was grossly infringing on German rights.Thus the Church did not seem to feel with the German people,
but to side unjustly with the enemy. The root of the whole evil lay, particularly
in Schonerer's opinion, in the fact that the di-recting body of the Catholic
Church was not in Germany, and that for this very reason alone it was hostile
to the interests of our nationality.The so-called cultural problems, in this as in virtually every
other connection in Austria at that time, were relegated almost entirely
to the background. The attitude of the Pan-German movement toward the Catholic
Church was determined far less by its position on science, etc., than by
its inadequacy in the championing of German rights and, conversely, its
continued aid and comfort to Slavic arrogance and greed.Georg Schonerer was not the man to do things by halves. He took
up the struggle toward the Church in the conviction that by it alone he
could save the German people. The 'AwayfromRome' movement seemed the most
powerful, though, to be sure, the most difficult, mode of attack, which
would inevitably shatter the hostile citadel. If it was successful, the
tragic church schism in Germany would be healed, and it was possible that
the inner strength of the Empire and the German nation would gain enormously
by such a victory.
But neither the premise nor the inference of this struggle was correct.
Without doubt the national force of resistance of the Catholic clergy of
German nationality, in all questions connected with Germanism, was less
than that of their non-German, particularly Czech, brethren.Likewise only an ignoramus could fail to see that an offensive
in favor of German interests was something that practically never occurred
to the German clergyman.And anyone who was not blind was forced equally to admit that
this was due primarily to a circumstance under which all of us Germans have
to suffer severely: that is, the objectivity of our attitude toward our
nationality as well as everything else.
While the Czech clergyman was subjective in his attitude toward his people
and objective only toward the Church, the German pastor was subjectively
devoted to the Church and remained objective toward the nation. A phenomenon
which, to our misfortune, we can observe equally well in thousands of other
cases.
This is by no means a special legacy of Catholicism, but with us it quickly
corrodes almost every institution, whether it be governmental or ideal.Just compare the position which our civil servants, for example,
take toward the attempts at a national awakening with the position which
in such a case the civil servants of another people would take. Or does
anyone believe that an officers' corps anywhere else in the world would
subordinate the interests of the nation amid mouthings about 'state authority,'
in the way that has been taken for granted in our country for the last five
years, in fact, has been viewed as especially meritorious? In the Jewish
question, for example, do not both denominations today take a standpoint
which corresponds neither to the requirements of the nation nor to the real
needs of religion? Compare the attitude of a Jewish rabbi in all questions
of even the slightest importance for the Jews as a race with the attitude
of by far the greatest part of our clergy-of both denominations, if you
please!We always find this phenomenon when it is a question of defending
an abstract idea as such.'State authority,' 'democracy,' 'pacifism,' 'international solidarity,'
etc., are all concepts which with us nearly always become so rigid and purely
doctrinaire that subsequently all purely national vital necessities are
judged exclusively from their standpoint.This catastrophic way of considering all matters from the angle
of a preconceived opinion kills every possibility of thinking oneself subjectively
into a matter which is objectively opposed to one's own doctrine, and finally
leads to a total reversal of means and ends. People will reject any attempt
at a national uprising if it can take place only after the elimination of
a bad, ruinous regime, since this would be an offense against 'state authority,'
and ' state authority ' is not a means to an end, but in the eyes of such
a fanatical objectivist rather represents the aim itself, which is sufficient
to fill out his whole lamentable life. Thus, for example, they would indignantly
oppose any attempt at a dictatorship, even if it was represented by a Frederick
the Great and the momentary political comedians of a parliamentary majority
were incapable dwarfs or really inferior characters, just because the law
of democracy seems holier to such a principle-monger than the welfare of
a nation. The one will therefore defend the worst tyranny, a tyranny which
is ruining the people, since at the moment it embodies 'state authority,'
while the other rejects even the most beneficial government as soon as it
fails to satisfy his conception of 'democracy.'In exactly the same way, our German pacifist will accept in
silence the bloodiest rape of our nation at-the hands of the most vicious
military powers if a change in this state of affairs can be achieved only
by resistance-that is, force-for this would be contrary to the spirit of
his peace society. Let the international German Socialist be plundered in
solidarity by the rest of the world, he will accept it with brotherly affection
and no thought of retribution or even defense, just because he is-a German.This may be a sad state of affairs, but to change a thing means
to recognize it first.The same is true of the weak defense of German interests by
a part of the clergy.It is neither malicious ill will in itself, nor is it caused,
let us say, by commands from 'above'; no, in such a lack of national determination
we see merely the result of an inadequate education in Germanism from childhood
up and, on the other hand, an unlimited submission to an idea which has
become an idol.Education in democracy, in socialism of the international variety,
in pacifism, etc., is a thing so rigid and exclusive, so purely subjective
from these points of view, that the general picture of the remaining world
is colored by this dogmatic conception, while the attitude toward Germanism
has remained exceedingly objective from early youth. Thus, the pacifist,
by giving himself subjectively and entirely to his idea, will, in the presence
of any menace to his people, be it ever so grave and unjust, always (in
so far as he is a German) seek after the objective right and never from
pure instinct of self-preservation join the ranks of his herd and fight
with them.To what extent this is also true of the different religions
is shown by the following:Protestantism as such is a better defender of the interests
of Germanism, in so far as this is grounded in its genesis and later tradition:
it fails, however, in the moment when this defense of national interests
must take place in a province which is either absent from the general line
of its ideological world and traditional development, or is for some reason
rejected.Thus, Protestantism will always stand up for the advancement
of all Germanism as such, as long as matters of inner purity or national
deepening as well as German freedom are involved since all these things
have a firm foundation in its own being; but it combats with the greatest
hostility any attempt to rescue the nation from the embrace of its most
mortal enemy, since its attitude toward the Jews just happens to be more
or less dogmatically established. Yet here we are facing the question without
whose solution all other attempts at a German reawakening or resurrection
are and remain absolutely senseless and impossible.In my Vienna period I had leisure and opportunity enough for
an unprejudiced examination of this question too, and in my daily contacts
was able to establish the correctness of this view a thousand times over.In this focus of the most varied nationalities, it immediately
becomes clearly apparent that the German pacifist is alone in always attempting
to view the interests of his own nation objectively, but that the Jew will
never regard those of the Jewish people in this way; that only the German
Socialist is linternaticnal' in a sense which forbids him to beg justice
for his own people except by whimpering and whining in the midst of his
international comrades, but never a Czech or a Pole, etc.; in short, I recognized
even then that the misfortune lies only partly in these doctrines, and partly
in our totally inadequate education in national sentiment and a resultant
lack of devotion to our nation.Thus, the first theoretical foundation for a struggle of the
PanGerman movement against Catholicism as such was lacking.Let the German people be raised from childhood up with that
exclusive recognition of the rights of their own nationality, and let not
the hearts of children be contaminated with the curse of our 'objectivity,'
even in matters regarding the preservation of their own ego. Then in a short
time it will be seen that (presupposing, of course, a radically national
government) in Germany, as in Ireland, Poland, or France, the Catholic will
always be a German.The mightiest proof of this was provided by that epoch which
for the last time led our nation into a life-and-death struggle before the
judgment seat of history in defense of its own existence.As long as leadership from above was not lacking, the people
fulfilled their duty and obligation overwhelmingly. Whether Protestant pastor
or Catholic priest, both together contributed infinitely in maintaining
for so long our power to resist, not only at the front but also at home.
In these years and particularly at the first flare, there really existed
in both camps but a single holy German Reich, for whose existence and future
each man turned to his own heaven.The Pan-German movement in Austria should have asked itself
one question:
Is the preservation of German-Austrianism possible under a Catholic faith,
or is it not? If yes, the political party had no right to concern itself
with religious or denominational matters; if not, then what was needed was
a religious reformation and never a political party.Anyone who thinks he can arrive at a religious reformation by
the detour of a political organization only shows that he has no glimmer
of knowledge of the development of religious ideas or dogmas and their ecclesiastical
consequences.Verily a man cannot serve two masters. And I consider the foundation
or destruction of a religion far greater than the foundation or destruction
of a state, let alone a party.And let it not be said that this is only a defense against the
attacks from the other side!It is certain that at all times unscrupulous scoundrels have
not shunned to make even religion the instrument of their political bargains
(for that is what such rabble almost always and exclusively deal in): but
just as certainly it is wrong to make a religious denomination responsible
for a
number of tramps who abuse it in exactly the same way as they would probably
make anything else serve their low instincts.Nothing can better suit one of these parliamentarian good-for-nothings
and lounge-lizards than when an opportunity is offered to justify his political
swindling, even after the fact.For as soon as religion or even denomination is made responsible
for his personal vices and attacked on that ground, this shameless liar
sets up a great outcry and calls the whole world to witness that his behavior
has been completely justified and that he alone and his eloquence are to
be thanked for saving religion of the Church. The public, as stupid as it
is forgetful, is, as a rule, prevented by the very outcry from recognizing
the real instigator of the struggle or else has forgotten him, and the scoundrel
has to all intents and purposes achieved his goal.The sly fox knows perfectly well that this has nothing to do
with religion; and he will silently laugh up his sleeve while his honest
but clumsy opponent loses the game and one day, despairing of the loyalty
and faith of humanity, withdraws from it all.And in another sense it would be unjust to make religion as
such or even the Church responsible for the failings of individuals. Compare
the greatness of the visible organization before our eyes with the average
fallibility of man in general, and you will have to admit that in it the
relation of good and evil is better than anywhere else. To be sure, even
among the priests themselves there are those to whom their holy office is
only a means of satisfying their political ambition, yes, who in political
struggle forget, in a fashion which is often more than deplorable that they
are supposed to be the guardians of a higher truth and not the representatives
of lies and slander-but for one such unworthy priest there are a thousand
and more honorable ones, shepherds most loyally devoted to their mission,
who, in our present false and decadent period, stand out of the general
morass like little islands.No more than I condemn, or would be justified in condemning,
the Church as such when a degenerate individual in a cassock obscenely transgresses
against morality, do I condemn it when one of the many others besmirches
and betrays his nationality at a time when this is a daily occurrence anyway.
Particularly today, we must not forget that for one such Ephialtes there
are thousands who with bleeding heart feel the misfortune of their people
and like the best of our nation long for the hour in which Heaven will smile
on us again.And if anyone replies that here we are not concerned with such
everyday problems, but with questions of principle and truth or dogmatic
content, we can aptly counter with another question:If you believe that you have been chosen by Fate to reveal the
truth in this matter, do so; but then have the courage to do so, not indirectly
through a political party-for this is a swindle; but for today's evil substitute
your future good.But if you lack courage, or if your good is not quite clear
even to yourself, then keep your fingers out of the matter; in any case,
do not attempt by roundabout sneaking through a political movement to do
what you dare not do with an open vizor.Political parties have nothing to do with religious problems,
as long as these are not alien to the nation, undermining the morals and
ethics of the race; just as religion cannot be amalgamated with the scheming
of political parties.When Church dignitaries make use of religious institutions or
doctrines to injure their nation, we must never follow them on this path
and fight with the same methods.For the political leader the religious doctrines and institutions
of his people trust always remain inviolable; or else he has no right to
be in politics, but should become a reformer, if he has what it takes!Especially in Germany any other attitude would lead to a catastrophe.In my study of the Pan-German movement and its struggle against
Rome, I then, and even more in the years to come, arrived at the following
conviction: This movement's inadequate appreciation of the importance of
the social problem cost it the truly militant mass of the people; its entry
into parliament took away its mighty impetus and burdened it with all the
weaknesses peculiar to this institution; the struggle against the Catholic
Church made it impossible in numerous small and middle circles, and thus
robbed it of countless of the best elements that the nation can call its
own.The practical result of the Austrian Kulturkampf At was next
toTo be sure, it succeeded in tearing some hundred thousand members
away from the Church, yet without causing it any particular damage. In this
case the Church really had no need to shed tears over the lost 'lambs';
for it lost only those who had long ceased to belong to it. The difference
between the new reformation and the old one was that in the old days many
of the best people in the Church turned away from it through profound religious
conviction, while now only those who were lukewarm to begin with departed,
and this from 'considerations' of a political nature.And precisely from the political standpoint the result was just
as laughable as it was sad.Once again a promising political movement for the salvation
of the German nation had gone to the dogs because it had not been led with
the necessary cold ruthlessness, but had lost itself in fields which could
only lead to disintegration.For one thing is assuredly true:The Pan-German movement would never have made this mistake but
for its insufficient understanding of the psyche of the broad masses. If
its leaders had known that to achieve any success one should, on purely
psychological grounds, never show the masses two or more opponents, since
this leads to a total disintegration of their fighting power, for this reason
alone the thrust of the Pan-German movement would have been directed at
a single adversary. Nothing is more dangerous for a political party than
to be led by those jacks-of-all-trades who want everything but can never
really achieve anything.Regardless how much room for criticism there was in any religious
denomination a political party must never for a moment lose sight of the
fact that in all previous historical experience a purely political party
in such situations had never succeeded in producing a religious reformation.
And the aim of studying history is not to forget its lessons when occasion
arises for its practical application, or to decide that the present situation
is different after all, and that therefore its old eternal truths are no
longer applicable; no, the purpose of studying history is precisely its
lesson for the present. The man who cannot do this must not conceive of
himself as a political leader; in reality he is a shallow, though usually
very conceited, fool, and no amount of good will can excuse his practical
incapacity.In general the art of all truly great national leaders at all
times consists among other things primarily in not dividing the attention
of a people, but in concentrating it upon a single foe. The more unified
the application of a people's will to fight, the greater will be the magnetic
attraction of a movement and the mightier will be the impetus of the thrust.
It belongs to the genius of a great leader to make even adversaries far
removed from one another seem to belong to a single category, because in
weak and uncertain characters the knowledge of having different enemies
can only too readily lead to the beginning of doubt in their own right.Once the wavering mass sees itself in a struggle against too
many enemies, objectivity will put in an appearance, throwing open the question
whether all others are really wrong and only their own people or their own
movement are in the right.And this brings about the first paralysis of their own power.
Hence a multiplicity of different adversaries must always be
combined so that in the eyes of the masses of one's own supporters the struggle
is directed against only one enemy. This strengthens their faith in their
own right and enhances their bitterness against those who attack it.That the old Pan-German movement failed to understand this deprived
it of success.Its goal had been correct, its will pure, but the road it chose
was wrong. It was like a mountain climber who keeps the peak to be climbed
in view and who sets out with the greatest determination and energy, but
pays no attention to the trail, for his eyes are always on his goal, so
that he neither sees nor feels out the character of the ascent and thus
comes to grief in the end.The opposite state of affairs seemed to prevail with its great
competitor, the Christian Social Party.The road it chose was correct and well-chosen, but it lacked
clear knowledge of its goal.In nearly all the matters in which the Pan-German movement was
wanting, the attitude of the Christian Social Party was correct and well-planned.It possessed the necessary understanding for the importance
of the masses and from the very first day assured itself of at least a part
of them by open emphasis on its social character. By aiming essentially
at winning the small and lower middle classes and artisans, it obtained
a following as enduring as it was self-sacrificing. It avoided any struggle
against a religious institution and thus secured the support of that mighty
organization which the Church represents. Consequently, it possessed only
a single truly great central opponent. It recognized the value of large-scale
propaganda and was a virtuoso in influencing the psychological instincts
of the broad masses of its adherents.If nevertheless it was unable to achieve its goal and dream
of saving Austria, this was due to two deficiencies in its method and to
its lack of clarity concerning the aim itself.The anti-Semitism of the new movement was based on religious
ideas instead of racial knowledge. The reason for the intrusion of this
mistake was the same which brought about the second fallacyIf the Christian Social Party wanted to save Austria, then is;
the opinion of its founders it must not operate from the standpoint of the
racial principle, for if it did a dissolution of the state would, in a short
time, inevitably occur. Particularly the situation in Vienna itself, in
the opinion of the party leaders, demanded that all points which would divide
their following should be set aside as much as possible, and that all unifying
conceptions be emphasized in their stead.At that time Vienna was so strongly permeated especially with
Czech elements that only the greatest tolerance with regard to all racial
questions could keep them in a party which was not anti-German to begin
with. If Austria were to be saved, this was indispensable. And so they attempted
to win over small Czech artisans who were especially numerous in Vienna,
by a struggle against liberal Manchesterism, and in the struggle against
the Jews on a religious basis they thought they had discovered a slogan
transcending all of old Austria's national differences.It is obvious that combating Jewry on such a basis could provide
the Jews with small cause for concern. If the worst came to the worst, a
splash of baptismal water could always save the business and the Jew at
the same time. With such a superficial motivation, a serious scientific
treatment of the whole problem was never achieved, and as a result far too
many people, to whom this type of anti-Semitism was bound to be incomprehensible,
were repelled. The recruiting power of the idea was limited almost exclusively
to intellectually limited circles, unless true knowledge were substituted
for purely emotional feeling. The intelligentsia remained aloof as a matter
of principle. Thus the whole movement came to look more and more like an
attempt at a new conversion of the Jews, or perhaps even an expression of
a certain competitive envy. And hence the struggle lost the character of
an inner and higher consecration; to many, and not necessarily the worst
people, it came to seem immoral and reprehensible. Lacking was the conviction
that this was a vital question for all humanity, with the fate of all non-Jewish
peoples depending on its solution.Through this halfheartedness the anti-Semitic line of the Christian
Social Party lost its value.It was a sham anti-Semitism which was almost worse than none
at all; for it lulled people into security; they thought they had the foe
by the ears, while in reality they themselves were being led by the nose.
In a short time the Jew had become so accustomed to this type of anti-Semitism
that he would have missed its disappearance more than its presence inconvenienced
him.If in this the Christian Social Party had to make a heavy sacrifice
to the state of nationalities, they had to make an even greater one when
it came to championing Germanism as such.They could not be 'nationalistic' unless they wanted to lose
the ground from beneath their feet in Vienna. They hoped that by a pussy-footing
evasion of this question they could still save the Habsburg state, and by
that very thing they encompassed its ruin. And the movement lost the mighty
source of power which alone can fill a political party with inner strength
for any length of time.Through this alone the Christian Social Party became a party
like any other.In those days I followed both movements most attentively One,
by feeling the beat of its innermost heart, the other, carried away by admiration
for the unusual man who even then seemed to me a bitter symbol of all Austrian
Germanism.When the mighty funeral procession bore the dead mayor from
the City Hall toward the Ring, I was among the many hundred thousands looking
on at the tragic spectacle. I was profoundly moved and my feelings told
me that the work, even of this man, was bound to be in vain, owing to the
fatal destiny which would inevitably lead this state to destruction. If
Dr. Karl Lueger had lived in Germany, he would have been ranked among the
great minds of our people; that he lived and worked in this impossible state
was the misfortune of his work and of himself.When he died, the little flames in the Balkans were beginning
to leap up more greedily from month to month, and it was a gracious fate
which spared him from witnessing what he still thought he could prevent.Out of the failure of the one movement and the miscarriage of
the other, I for my part sought to find the causes, and came to the certain
conviction that, quite aside from the impossibility of bolstering up the
state in old Austria, the errors of the two parties were as follows:The Pan-German movement was right in its theoretical view about
the aim of a German renascence, but unfortunate in its choice of methods.
It was nationalistic, but unhappily not socialistic enough to win the masses.
But its anti-Semitism was based on a correct understanding of the importance
of the racial problem, and not on religious ideas. Its struggle against
a definite denomination, however, was actually and tactically false.The Christian Social movement had an unclear conception of the
aim of a German reawakening, but had intelligence and luck in seeking its
methods as a party. It understood the importance of the social question,
erred in its struggle against the Jews, and had no notion of the power of
the national idea.If, in addition to its enlightened knowledge of the broad masses,
the Christian Social Party had had a correct idea of the importance of the
racial question, such as the Pan-German movement had achieved; and if, finally,
it had itself been nationalistic, or if the Pan-German movement, in addition
to its correct knowledge of the aim of the Jewish question, had adopted
the practical shrewdness of the Christian Social Party, especially in its
attitude toward socialism, there would have resulted a movement which even
then in my opinion might have successfully intervened in German destiny.If this did not come about, it was overwhelmingly due to the
nature of the Austrian state.Since I saw my conviction realized in no other party, I could
in the period that followed not make up my mind to enter, let alone fight
with, any of the existing organizations. Even then I regarded all political
movements as unsuccessful and unable to carry out a national reawakening
of the German people on a larger and not purely external scale.But in this period my inner revulsion toward the Habsburg state
steadily grew.The more particularly I concerned myself with questions of foreign
policy, the more my conviction rose and took root that this political formation
could result in nothing but the misfortune of Germanism. More and more clearly
I saw at last that the fate of the German nation would no longer be decided
here, but in the Reich itself. This was true, not only of political questions,
but no less for all manifestations of cultural life in general.Also in the field of cultural or artistic affairs, the Austrian
state showed all symptoms of degeneration, or at least of unimportance for
the German nation. This was most true in the field of architecture. The
new architecture could achieve no special successes in Austria, if for no
other reason because since the completion of the Ring its tasks, in Vienna
at least, had become insignificant in comparison with the plans arising
in Germany.Thus more and more I began to lead a double life; reason and
reality told me to complete a school as bitter as it was beneficial in Austria,
but my heart dwelt elsewhere.An oppressive discontent had seized possession of me, the more
I recognized the inner hollowness of this state and the impossibility of
saving it, and felt that in all things it could be nothing but the misfortune
of the German people.I was convinced that this state inevitably oppressed and handicapped
any really great German as, conversely, it would help every un-German figure.I was repelled by the conglomeration of races which the capital
showed me, repelled by this whole mixture of Czechs, Poles, Hungarians,
Ruthenians, Serbs, and Croats, and everywhere, the eternal mushroom of humanity-Jews
and more Jews.To me the giant city seemed the embodiment of racial desecration.The German of my youth was the dialect of Lower Bavaria, I could
neither forget it nor learn the Viennese jargon. The longer I lived in this
city, the more my hatred grew for the foreign mixture of peoples which had
begun to corrode this old site of German culture.The idea that this state could be maintained much longer seemed
to me positively ridiculous.Austria was then like an old mosaic; the cement, binding the
various little stones together, had grown old and begun to crumble; as long
as the work of art is not touched, it can continue to give a show of existence,
but as soon as it receives a blow, it breaks into a thousand fragments.
The question was only when the blow would come.Since my heart had never beaten for an Austrian monarchy, but
only for a German Reich, the hour of this state's downfall could only seem
to me the beginning of the redemption of the German nation.For all these reasons a longing rose stronger and stronger in
me, to go at last whither since my childhood secret desires and secret love
had drawn me.I hoped some day to make a name for myself as an architect and
thus, on the large or small scale which Fate would allot me, to dedicate
my sincere services to the nation.But finally I wanted to enjoy the happiness of living and working
in the place which some day would inevitably bring about the fulfillment
of my most ardent and heartfelt wish: the union of my beloved homeland with
the common fatherland, the German Reich.Even today many would be unable to comprehend the greatness
of such a longing, but I address myself to those to whom Fate has either
hitherto denied this, or from whom in harsh cruelty it has taken it away;
I address myself to all those who, detached from their mother country, have
to fight even for the holy treasure of their language, who are persecuted
and tortured for their loyalty to the fatherland, and who now, with poignant
emotion, long for the hour which will permit them to return to the heart
of their faithful mother; I address myself to all these, and I know that
they will understand me !Only he who has felt in his own skin what it means to be a German,
deprived of the right to belong to his cherished fatherland, can measure
the deep longing which burns at all times in the hearts of children separated
from their mother country. It torments those whom it fills and denies them
contentment and happiness until the gates of their father's house open,
and in the common Reich, common blood gains peace and tranquillity.Yet Vienna was and remained for me the hardest, though most
thorough, school of my life. I had set foot in this town while still half
a boy and I left it a man, grown quiet and grave. In it I obtained the foundations
for a philosophy in general and a political view in particular which later
I only needed to supplement in detail, but which never left me. But not
until today have I been able to estimate at their full value those years
of study.That is why I have dealt with this period at some length, because
it gave me my first visual instruction in precisely those questions which
belonged to the foundations of a party which, arising from smallest beginnings,
after scarcely five years is beginning to develop into a great mass movement.
I do not know what my attitude toward the Jews, Social Democracy, or rather
Marxism as a whole, the social question, etc., would be today if at such
an early time the pressure of destiny-and my own study -had not built up
a basic stock of personal opinions within me.For if the misery of the fatherland can stimulate thousands
and thousands of men to thought on the inner reasons for this collapse,
this can never lead to that thoroughness and deep insight which are disclosed
to the man who has himself mastered Fate only after years of struggle.


IN THE SPRING of 1912 I came at last to Munich.The city itself was as familiar to me as if I had lived for
years within its walls. This is accounted for by my study which at every
step had led me to this metropolis of German art. Not only has one not seen
Germany if one does not know Munich-no, above all, one does not know German
art if one has not seen Munich.In any case, this period before the War was the happiest and
by far the most contented of my life. Even if my earnings were still extremely
meager, I did not live to be able to paint, but painted only to be able
to secure my livelihood or rather to enable myself to go on studying. I
possessed the conviction that I should some day, in spite of all obstacles,
achieve the goal I had set myself. And this alone enabled me to bear all
other petty cares of daily existence lightly and without anxiety.
In addition to this, there was the heartfelt love which seized me for this
city more than for any other place that I knew, almost from the first hour
of my sojourn there. A German city! What a difference from Vienna! I grew
sick to my stomach when I even thought back on this Babylon of races. In
addition, the dialect, much closer to me, which particularly in my contacts
with Lower Bavarians, reminded me of my former childhood. There were a thousand
and more things which were or became inwardly dear and precious to me. But
most of all I was attracted by this wonderful marriage of primordial power
and fine artistic mood, this single line from the Hofbrauhaus to the Odeon,
from the October Festival to the Pinakothek, etc. If today I am more attached
to this city than to any other spot of earth in this world, it is partly
due to the fact that it is and remains inseparably bound up with the development
of my own life; if even then I achieved the happiness of a truly inward
contentment, it can be attributed only to the magic which the miraculous
residence of the Wittelsbachs exerts on every man who is blessed, not only
with a calculating mind but with a feeling soul.What attracted me most aside from my professional work was,
here again, the study of the political events of the day, among them particularly
the occurrences in the field of foreign affairs. I came to these latter
indirectly through the German alliance policy which from my Austrian days
I considered absolutely mistaken. However, the full extent of this self-deception
on the part of the Reich had not been clear to me in Vienna. In those days
I was inclined to assume-or perhaps I merely talked myself into it as an
excuse-that Berlin perhaps knew how weak and unreliable the ally would be
in reality, yet, for more or less mysterious reasons, held back this knowledge
in order to bolster up an alliance policy which after all Bismarck himself
had founded and the sudden cessation of which could not be desirable, if
for no other reason lest the lurking foreigner be alarmed in any way, or
the shopkeeper at home be worried.To be sure, my associations, particularly among the people itself,
soon made me see to my horror that this belief was false. To my amazement
I could not help seeing everywhere that even in otherwise well-informed
circles there was not the slightest glimmer of knowledge concerning the
nature of the Habsburg monarchy. Particularly the common people were caught
in the mad idea that the ally could be regarded as a serious power which
in the hour of need would surely rise to the situation. Among the masses
the monarchy was still regarded as a ' German' state on which we could count.
They were of the opinion that there, too, the power could be measured by
the millions as in Germany itself, and completely forgot that, in the first
place: Austria had long ceased to be a German state; and in the second place:
the internal conditions of this Empire were from hour to hour moving closer
to disintegration.I had come to know this state formation better than the so-called
official 'diplomats,' who blindly, as almost always, rushed headlong toward
catastrophe; for the mood of the people was always a mere discharge of what
was funneled into public opinion from above. But the people on top made
a cult of the 'ally,' as if it were the Golden Calf. They hoped to replace
by cordiality what was lacking in honesty. And words were always taken for
coin of the realm.
Even in Vienna I had been seized with anger when I reflected on the disparity
appearing from time to time between the speeches of the official statesmen
and the content of the Viennese press. And yet Vienna, in appearance at
least, was still a German city. How different it was if you left Vienna,
or rather German-Austria, and went to the Slavic provinces of the Empire
! You had only to take up the Prague newspapers to find out what they thought
of the whole exalted hocus-pocus of the Triple Alliance. There there was
nothing but bitter scorn and mockery for this 'masterpiece of statecraft.'
In the midst of peace, with both emperors pressing kisses of friendship
on each other's foreheads, the Czechs made no secret of the fact that this
alliance would be done for on the day when an attempt should be made to
translate it from the moonbeams of the Nibelungen ideal into practical reality.What excitement seized these same people several years later
when the time finally came for the alliances to show their worth and Italy
leapt out of the triple pact, leaving her two comrades in the lurch, and
in the end even becoming their enemy ! That anyone even for a moment should
have dared to believe in the possibility of such a miracle-to wit, the mirade
that Italy would fight side by side with Austria-could be nothing but incomprehensible
to anyone who was not stricken with diplomatic blindness. But in Austria
things were not a hair's-breadth different.In Austria the only exponents of the alliance idea were the
Habsburgs and the Germans. The Habsburgs, out of calculation and compulsion;
the Germans, from good faith and political-stupidity. From good faith, for
they thought that by the Triple Alliance they were performing a great service
for the German Reich itself, helping to strengthen and secure it; from political
stupidity, because neither did the first-mentioned occur, but on the contrary,
they thereby helped to chain the Reich to the corpse of a state which would
inevitably drag them both into the abyss, and above all because they themselves,
solely by virtue of this alliance, fell more and more a prey to de-Germanization.
For by the alliance with the Reich, the Habsburgs thought they could be
secure against any interference from this side, which unfortunately was
the case, and thus they were able far more easily and safely to carry through
their internal policy of slowly eliminating Germanism. Not only that in
view of our well-known ' objectivity' they had no need to fear any intervention
on the part of the Reich government, but, by pointing to the alliance, they
could also silence any embarrassing voice among the Austrian-Germans which
might rise in German quarters against Slavization of an excessively disgraceful
character.For what was the German in Austria to do if the Germans of the
Reich recognized and expressed confidence in the Habsburg government? Should
he offer resistance and be branded by the entire German public as a traitor
to his own nationality? When for decades he had been making the most enormous
sacrifices precisely for his nationality!But what value did this alliance have, once Germanism had been
exterminated in the Habsburg monarchy? Wasn't the value of the Triple Alliance
for Germany positively dependent on the preservation of German predominance
in Austria? Or did they really believe that they could live in an alliance
with a SlavicHabsburg Empire?The attitude of official German diplomacy and of all public
opinion toward the internal Austrian problem of nationalities was beyond
stupidity, it was positively insane ! They banked on an alliance, made the
future and security of a people of seventy millions dependent on it-and
looked on while the sole basis for this alliance was from year to year,
inexorably and by plan, being destroyed in the partner-nation. The day was
bound to come when a ' treaty ' with Viennese diplomacy would remain, but
the aid of an allied empire would be lost.With Italy this was the case from the very beginning.If people in Germany had only studied history a little more
clearly, and gone into the psycholog of nations, they would not have been
able to suppose even for an hour that the Quirinal and the Vienna Hofburg
would ever stand together n a common fighting front. Sooner would Italy
have turned into a volcano than a government have dared to send even a single
Italian to the battlefield for the fanatically hated Habsburg state, except
as an enemy. More than once in Vienna I saw outbursts of the passionate
contempt and bottomless hatred with which the Italian was ' devoted ' to
the Austrian state. The sins of the House of Habsburg against Italian freedom
and independence in the course of the centuries was too great to be forgotten,
even if the will to forget them had been present. And it was not present;
neither in the people nor in the Italian government. For Italy there were
therefore two possibilities for relations with Austna: either alliance or
war.By choosing the first, the Italians were able to prepare, undisturbed,
for the second.Especially since the relation of Austria to Russia had begun
to drive closer and closer to a military clash, the German alliance policy
was as senseless as it was dangerous.This was a classic case, bearing witness to the absence of any
broad and correct line of thinking.Why, then, was an alliance concluded? Only in order better to
guard the future of the Reich than, reduced to her own resources, she would
have been in a position to do. And this future of the Reich was nothing
other than the question of preserving the German people's possibility of
existence.Therefore the question could be formulated only as follows:What form must the life of the German nation assume in the tangible
future, and how can this development be provided with the necessary foundations
and the required security within the framework of general European relation
of forces?A clear examination of the premises for foreign activity on
the part of German statecraft inevitably led to the following conviction:Germany has an annual increase in population of nearly nine
hundred thousand souls. The difficulty of feeding this army of new citizens
must grow greater from year to year and ultimately end in catastrophe, unless
ways and means are found to forestall the danger of starvation and misery
in time.There were four ways of avoiding so terrible a development for
the future:1. Following the French example, the increase of births could
be artificially restricted, thus meeting the problem of overpopulationNature herself in times of great poverty or bad climactic conditions,
as well as poor harvest, intervenes to restrict the increase of population
of certain countries or races; this, to be sure, by a method as wise as
it is ruthless. She diminishes, not the power of procreation as such, but
the conservation of the procreated, by exposing them to hard trials and
deprivations with the result that all those who are less strong and less
healthy are forced back into the womb of the eternal unknown. Those whom
she permits to survive the inclemency of existence are a thousandfold tested
hardened, and well adapted to procreate-in turn, in order that the process
of thoroughgoing selection may begin again from the beginning. By thus brutally
proceeding against the individual and immediately calling him back to herself
as soon as he shows himself unequal to the storm of life, she keeps the
race and species strong, in fact, raises them to the highest accomplishments.At the same time the diminution of number strengthens the individual
and thus in the last analysis fortifies the species.It is different, however, when man undertakes the limitation
of his number. He is not carved of the same wood, he is ' humane.' He knows
better than the cruel queen of wisdom. He limits not the conservation of
the individual, but procreation itself. This seems to him, who always sees
himself and never the race, more human and more justified than the opposite
way. Unfortunately, however, the consequences are the reverse:While Nature, by making procreation free, yet submitting survival
to a hard trial, chooses from an excess number of individuals the best as
worthy of living, thus preserving them alone and in them conserving their
species, man limits procreation, but is hysterically concerned that once
a being is born it should be preserved at any price. This correction of
the divine will seems to him as wise as it is humane, and he takes delight
in having once again gotten the best of Nature and even having proved her
inadequacy. The number, to be sure, has really been limited, but at the
same time the value of the individual has dirninished; this, however, is
something the dear little ape of the Almighty does not want to see or hear
about.For as soon as procreation as such is limited and the number
of births diminished, the natural struggle for existence which leaves only
the strongest and healthiest alive is obviously replaced by the obvious
desire to ' save ' even the weakest and most sickly at any price, and this
plants the seed of a future generation which must inevitably grow more and
more deplorable the longer this mockery of Nature and her will continues.And the end will be that such a people will some day be deprived
of its existence on this earth; for man can defy the eternal laws of the
will to conservation for a certain time, but sooner or later vengeance comes.
A stronger race will drive out the weak, for the vital urge in its ultimate
form will, time and again, burst all the absurd fetters of the so-called
humanity of individuals, in order to replace it by the humanity of Nature
which destroys the weak to give his place to the strong.Therefore, anyone who wants to secure the existence of the German
people by a self-limitation of its reproduction is robbing it of its future.2. A second way would be one which today we, time and time again,
see proposed and recommended: internal colonization. This is a proposal
which is well meant by just as many as by most people it is misunderstood,
thus doing the greatest conceivable damage that anyone can imaginedWithout doubt the productivity of the soil can be increased
up to a certain limit. But only up to a certain limit, and not continuously
without end. For a certain time it will be possible to compensate for the
increase of the German people without having to think of hunger, by increasing
the productivity of our soil. But beside this, we must face the fact that
our demands on life ordinarily nse even more rapidly than the number of
the population Man's requirements with regard to food and clothing increase
from year to year, and even now, for example, stand in no relation to the
requirements of our ancestors, say a hundred years ago. It IS, therefore,
insane to believe that every rise in production provides the basis for an
increase in population: no; this is true only up to a certain degree, since
at least a part of the increased production of the soil is spent in satisfying
the increased needs of men. But even with the greatest limitation on the
one hand and the utmost industry on the other, here again a limit will one
day be reached, created by the soil itself. With the utmost toil it will
not be possible to obtain any more from its and then, though postponed for
a certain time, catastrophe again manifests itself. First, there will be
hunger from time to time, when there is famine, etc. As the population increases,
this will happen more and more often, so that finally it will only be absent
when rare years of great abundance fill the granaries. But at length the
time approaches when even then it will not be possible to satisfy men's
needs, and hunger has become the eternal companion of such a people. Then
Nature must help again and make a choice among those whom she has chosen
for life; but again man helps himself; that is, he turns to artificial restriction
of his increase with all the above-indicated dire consequences for race
and species.The objection may still be raised that this future will face
the whole of humanity in any case and that consequently the individual nation
can naturally not avoid this fate.At first glance this seems perfectly correct. Yet here the following
must be borne in mind:Assuredly at a certain time the whole of humanity will be compelled,
in consequence of the impossibility of making the fertility of the soil
keep pace with the continuous increase in population, to halt the increase
of the human race and either let Nature again decide or, by self-help if
possible, create the necessary balance, though, to be sure, in a more correct
way than is done today. But then this will strike all peoples, while today
only those races are stricken with such suffering which no longer possess
the force and strength to secure for themselves the necessary territories
in this world. For as matters stand there are at the present time on this
earth immense areas of unusued soil, only waiting for the men to till them.
But it is equally true that Nature as such has not reserved this soil for
the future possession of any particular nation or race; on the contrary,
this soil exists for the people which possesses the force to take it and
the industry to cultivate it.Nature knows no political boundaries. First, she puts living
creatures on this globe and watches the free play of forces. She then confers
the master's right on her favorite child, the strongest in courage and industry.When a people limits itself to internal colonization because
other races are clinging fast to greater and greater surfaces of this earth,
it will be forced to have recourse to self-limitation at a time when the
other peoples are still continuing to increase. Some day this situation
will arise, and the smaller the living space at the disposal of the people,
the sooner it will happen. Since in general, unfortunately, the best nations,
or, even more correctly, the only truly cultured races, the standard-bearers
of all human progress, all too frequently resolve in their pacifistic blindness
to renounce new acquisitions of soil and content themselves with 'internal'
colonization, while the inferior races know how to secure immense living
areas in this world for themselves-this would lead to the following final
result:The culturally superior, but less ruthless races, would in consequence
of their limited soil, have to limit their increase at a time when the culturally
inferior but more brutal and more natural t peoples, in consequence of their
greater living areas, would still be in a position to increase without limit.
In other words: some day the world will thus come into possession of the
culturally inferior but more active men.Then, though in a perhaps very distant future, there will be
but two possibilities either the world will be governed according to the
ideas of our modern democracy, and then the weight of any decision will
result in favor of the numerically stronger races, or the world will be
dominated in accordance with the laws of the natural order of force, and
then it is the peoples of brutal will who will conquer, and consequently
once again not the nation of selfrestriction.No one can doubt that this world will some day be exposed to
the severest struggles for the existence of mankind. In the end, only the
urge for self-preservation can conquer. Beneath it socalled humanity, the
expression of a mixture of stupidity, cowardice, and know-it-all conceit,
will melt like snow in the March sun. Mankind has grown great in eternal
struggle, and only in eternal peace does it perish.For us Germans the slogan of 'inner colonization' is catastrophic,
if for no other reason because it automatically reinforces us in the opinion
that we have found a means which, in accordance with the pacifistic tendency,
allows us ' to earn ' our right to exist by labor in a life of sweet slumbers.
Once this doctrine were taken seriously in our country, it would mean the
end of every exertion to preserve for ourselves the place which is our due.
Once the average German became convinced that he could secure his life and
future in this way, all attempts at an active, and hence alone fertile,
defense of German vital necessities would be doomed to failure. In the face
of such an attitude on the part of the nation any really beneficial foreign
policy could be regarded as buried, and with it the future of the German
people as a whole.Taking these consequences into account, it is no accident that
it is always primarily the Jew who tries and succeeds in planting such mortally
dangerous modes of thought in our people. He knows his customers too well
not to realize that they gratefully let themselves be swindled by any gold-brick
salesman who can make them think he has found a way to play a little trick
on Nature, to make the hard, inexorable struggle for existence superfluous,
and instead, sometimes by work, but sometimes by plain doing nothing, depending
on how things 'come out,' to become the lord of the planet.It cannot be emphasized sharply enough that any German internal
colonization must serve to eliminate social abuses particularly to withdraw
the soil from widespread speculation, best can never suffice to secure the
future of the nation without the acquisition of new soil.If we do not do this, we shall in a short time have arrived,
not only at the end of our soil, but also at the end of our strength.Finally, the following must be stated:The limitation to a definite small area of soil, inherent in
internal colonization, like the same final effect obtained by restriction
of procreation, leads to an exceedingly unfavorable politicomilitary situation
in the nation in question.The size of the area inhabited by a people constitutes in itself
an essential factor for determining its outward security. The greater the
quantity of space at the disposal of a people, the greater its natural protection;
for military decisions against peoples living in a small restricted area
have always been obtained more quickly and hence more easily, and in particular
more effectively and completely than can, conversely, be possible against
territorially extensive states. In the size of a state's territory there
always lies a certain protection against frivolous attacks, since success
can be achieved only after hard struggles, and therefore the risk of a rash
assault will seem too great unless there are quite exceptional grounds for
it. Hence the very size of a state offers in itself a basis for more easily
preserving the freedom and independence of a people, while, conversely,
the smallness of such a formation is a positive invitation to seizure.Actually the two first possibilities for creating a balance
between the rising population and the stationary amount of soil were rejected
in the so-called national circles of the Reich. The reasons for this position
were, to be sure, different from those above mentioned: government circles
adopted a negative attitude toward the limitation of births out of a certain
moral feeling; they indignantly rejected internal colonization because in
it they scented an attack against large landholdings and therein the beginning
of a wider struggle against private property in general. In view of the
form in which particularly the latter panacea was put forward, they may
very well have been right in this assumption.On the whole, the defense against the broad masses was not very
skillful and by no means struck at the heart of the problem.
Thus there remained but two ways of securing work and bread for the rising
population.3. Either new soil could be acquired and the superfluous millions
sent off each year, thus keeping the nation on a selfsustaining basis; or
we could4. Produce for foreign needs through industry and commerce,
and defray the cost of living from the proceeds.In other words: either a territorial policy, or a colonial and
commercial policy.Both ways were contemplated, examined, recommended, and combated
by different political tendencies, and the last was finally taken.The healthier way of the two would, to be sure, have been the
first.The acquisition of new soil for the settlement of the excess
population possesses an infinite number of advantages, particularly if wee
turn from the present to the future.For once thing, the possibility of preserving a healthy peasant
class as a foundation for a whole nation can never be valued highly enough.
Many of our present-day sufferings are only the consequence of the unhealthy
relationship between rural and city population A solid stock of small and
middle peasants has at all times been the best defense against social ills
such as we possess today. And, moreover this is the only solution which
enables a nation to earn its daily bread within the inner circuit of its
economy. Industry and commerce recede from their unhealthy leading position
and adjust themselves to the general framework of a national economy of
balanced supply and demand. Both thus cease to be the basis of the nation's
sustenance and become a mere instrument to that end. Since they now have
only a balance ' Aberdeen domestic production and demand in all fields,
they make the Subsistence of the people as a whole more or less independent
foreign countries, and thus help to secure the freedom of the stite and
the independence of the nation, particularly in difficult Periods.
It must be said that such a territorial policy cannot be fulfilled in the
Cameroons, but today almost exclusively in Europe. We must, therefore, coolly
and objectively adopt the standpoint that it can certainly not be the intention
of Heaven to give one people fifty times as much land and soil in this world
as another. In this case we must not let political boundaries obscure for
us the boundaries of eternal justice. If this earth really has room for
all to live in, let us be given the soil we need for our livelihood.True, they will no t willingly do this. But then the law of
selfpreservaion goes into effect; and what is refused to amicable methods,
it is up to the fist to take. If our forefathers had let their decisions
depend on the same pacifistic nonsense as our contemporaries, we should
possess only a third of our present territory; but in that case there would
scarcely be any German people for us to worry about in Europe today. No-it
is to our natural determination to fight for our own existence that we owe
the two Ostmarks of the Reich and hence that inner strength arising from
the greatness of our state and national territory which alone has enabled
us to exist up to the present.And for another reason this would have been the correct solutionToday many European states are like pyramids stood on their
heads. Their European area is absurdly small in comparison to their weight
of colonies, foreign trade, etc. We may say: summit in Europe, base in the
whole world; contrasting with the American Union which possesses its base
in its own continent and touches the rest of the earth only with its summit.
And from this comes the immense inner strength of this state and the weakness
of most European colonial powers.Nor is England any proof to the contrary, since in consideration
of the British Empire we too easily forget the Anglo-Saxon world as such.
The position of England, if only because of her linguistic and cultural
bond with the American Union, can be compared to no other state in Europe.For Germany, consequently, the only possibility for carrying
out a healthy territorial policy lay in the acquisition of new land in Europe
itself. Colonies cannot serve this purpose unless they seem in large part
suited for settlement by Europeans. But in the nineteenth century such colonial
territories were no longer obtainable by peaceful means. Consequently, such
a colonial policy could only have been carried out by means of a hard struggle
which, however, would have been carried on to much better purpose, not for
territories outside of Europe, but for land on the home continent itself.Such a decision, it is true, demands undivided devotion. It
is not permissible to approach with half measures or even with hesitation
a task whose execution seems possible only by the harnessing of the very
last possible ounce of energy. This means that the entire political leadership
of the Reich should have devoted itself to this exclusive aim; never should
any step have been taken, guided by other considerations than the recognition
of this task and its requirements. It was indispensable to see dearly that
this aim could be achieved only by struggle, and consequently to face the
contest of arms with calm and composure.All alliances, therefore, should have been viewed exclusively
from this standpoint and judged according to their possible utilization.
If land was desired in Europe, it could be obtained by and large only at
the expense of Russia, and this meant that the new Reich must again set
itself on the march along the road of the Teutonic Knights of old, to obtain
by the German sword sod for the German plow and daily bread for the nation.For such a policy there was but one ally in Europe: England.With England alone was it possible, our rear protected, to begin
the new Germanic march. Our right to do this would have been no less than
the right of our forefathers. None of our pacifists refuses to eat the bread
of the East, although the first plowshare in its day bore the name of 'sword'
!Consequently, no sacrifice should have been too great for winning
England's willingness. We should have renounced colonies and sea power,
and spared English industry our competition.Only an absolutely clear orientation could lead to such a goal:
renunciation of world trade and colonies; renunciation of a German war fleet;
concentration of all the state's instruments of power on the land army.The result, to be sure, would have been a momentary limitation
but a great and mighty future.There was a time when England would have listened to reason
on this point, since she was well aware that Germany as a result of her
increased population had to seek some way out and either find it with England
in Europe or without England in the world.And it can primarily be attributed to this realization if at
the turn of the century London itself attempted to approach Germany. For
the first time a thing became evident which in the last years we have had
occasion to observe in a truly terrifying fashion. People were unpleasantly
affected by the thought of having to pull Fngland's chestnuts out of the
fire; as though there ever could be an alliance on any other basis than
a mutual business deal. And with England such a deal could very well have
been made. British diplomacy was still clever enough to realize that no
service can be expected without a return.Just suppose that an astute German foreign policy had taken
over the role of Japan in 1904, and we can scarcely measure the consequences
this would have had for Germany.There would never have been any 'World War.'The bloodshed in the year 1904 would have saved ten times as
much in the years 1914 to 1918.And what a position Germany would occupy in the world today!In that light, to be sure, the alliance with Austria was an
absurdity.For this mummy of a state allied itself with Germany, not in
order to fight a war to its end, but for the preservation of an eternal
peace which could astutely be used for the slow but certain extermination
of Germanism in the monarchy.This alliance was an impossibility for another reason: because
we could not expect a state to take the offensive in championing national
German interests as long as this state did not possess the power and determination
to put an end to the process of de-Germanization on its own immediate borders.
If Germany did not possess enough national awareness and ruthless determination
to snatch power over the destinies of ten million national comrades from
the hands of the impossible Habsburg state, then truly we had no right to
expect that she would ever lend her hand to such farseeing and bold plans.
The attitude of the old Reich on the Austrian question was the touchstone
of its conduct in the struggle for the destiny of the whole nation.In any case we were not justified in looking on, as year after
year Germanism was increasingly repressed, since the value of Aushia's fitness
for alliance was determined exclusively by the preservation of the German
element.This road, however, was not taken at all.These people feared nothing so much as struggle, yet they were
finally forced into it at the most unfavorable hour.They wanted to run away from destiny, and it caught up with
them. They dreamed of preserving world peace, and landed in the World War.And this was the most significant reason why this third way
of molding the German future was not even considered. They knew that the
acquisition of new soil was possible only in the East, they saw the struggle
that would be necessary and yet wanted peace at any price; for the watchword
of German foreign policy had long ceased to be: preservation of the German
nation by all methods; but rather: preservation of world peace by all means.
With what success, everyone knows.I shall return to this point in particular.Thus there remained the fourth possibilityIndustry and world trade, sea power and colonies.Such a development, to be sure, was at first easier and also
more quickly attainable. The settlement of land is a slow process, often
lasting centuries; in fact, its inner strength is to be sought precisely
in the fact that it is not a sudden blaze, but a gradual yet solid and continuous
growth, contrasting with an industrial development which can be blown up
in the course of a few years, but in that case is more like a soapbubble
than solid strength. A fieet, to be sure, can be built more quickly than
farms can be established in stubborn struggle and settled with peasants,
but it is also more rapidly destroyed than the latter.If, nevertheless, Germany took this road, she should at least
have clearly recognized that this development would some day likewise end
in struggle. Only children could have thought that they could get their
bananas in the 'peaceful contest of nations,' by friendly and moral conduct
and constant emphasis on their peaceful intentions, as they so high-soundingly
and unctuously babbled; in other words, without ever having to take up arms.
No: if we chose this road, England would some day inevitably become our
enemy. It was more than senseless-but quite in keeping with our own innocence-to
wax indignant over the fact that England should one day take the liberty
to oppose our peaceful activity with the brutality of a violent egoist.It is true that we, I am sorry to say, would never have done
such a thing.If a European territorial policy was only possible against Russia
in alliance with England, conversely, a policy of colonies and world trade
was conceivable only against England and with Russia. But then we had dauntlessly
to draw the consequences- and, above all, abandon Austria in all haste.Viewed from all angles, this alliance with Austria was real
madness by the turn of the century.But we did not think of concluding an alliance with Russia against
England, any more than with England against Russia, for in both cases the
end would have been war, and to prevent this we decided in favor of a policy
of commerce and industry. In the 'peaceful economic ' conquest of the world
we possessed a recipe which was expected to break the neck of the former
policy of violence once and for all.l Occasionally, perhaps, we were not
quite sure of ourselves, particularly when from time to time incomprehensible
threats came over from England; therefore, we decided to build a fleet,
though not to attack and destroy England, but for the 'defense' of our old
friend 'world peace' and 'peaceful ' conquest of the world. Consequently,
it was kept on a somewhat more modest scale in all respects, not only in
number but also in the tonnage of the individual ships as well as in armament,
so as in the final analysis to let our 'peaceful' intentions shine through
after all.The talk about the 'peaceful economic' conquest of the world
was possibly the greatest nonsense which has ever been exalted to be a guiding
principle of state policy. What made this nonsense even worse was that its
proponents did not hesitate to call upon England as a crown witness for
the possibility of such an achievement. The crimes of our academic doctrine
and conception of history in this connection can scarcely be made good and
are only a striking proof of how many people there are who 'learn' history
without understanding or even comprehending it. England, in particular,
should have been recognized as the striking refutation of this theory; for
no people has ever with greater brutality better prepared its economic conquests
with the sword, and later ruthlessly defended theme than the English nation.
Is it not positively the distinguishing feature of British statesmanship
to draw economic acquisitions from political strength, and at once to recast
every gain in economic strength into political power? And what an error
to believe that England is personally too much of a coward to stake her
own blood for her economic policy! The fact that the English people possessed
no 'people's army' in no way proved the contrary; for what matters is not
the momentary military form of the fighting forces, but rather the will
and determination to risk those which do exist. England has always possessed
whatever armament she happened to need. She always fought with the weapons
which success demanded. She fought with mercenaries as long as mercenaries
sufficed; but she reached down into the precious blood of the whole nation
when only such a sacrifice could bring victory; but the determination for
victory, the tenacity and ruthless pursuit of this struggle, remained unchanged.In Germany, however, the school, the press, and comic magazines
cultivated a conception of the Englishman's character, and almost more so
of his empire, which inevitably led to one of the most insidious delusions;
for gradually everyone was infected by this nonsense, and the consequence
was an underestimation for which we would have to pay most bitterly. This
falsification went so deep that people became convinced that in the Englishman
they faced a business man as shrewd as personally he was unbelievably cowardly.
The fact that a world empire the size of the British could not be put together
by mere subterfuge and swindling was unfortunately something that never
even occurred to our exalted professors of academic science. The few who
raised a voice of warning were ignored or killed by silence. I remember
well my comrades' looks of astonishment when we faced the Tommies in person
in Flanders. After the very first days of battle the conviction dawned on
each and every one of them that these Scotsmen did not exactly jibe with
the pictures they had seen fit to give us in the comic magazines and press
dispatches.It was then that I began my first reflections about the importance
of the form of propaganda.
This falsification, however, did have one good side for those who spread
it: by this example, even though it was incorrect, they were able to demonstrate
the correctness of the economic conquest of the world. If the Englishman
had succeeded, we too were bound to succeed, and our definitely greater
honesty, the absence in us of that specifically English 'perfidy,' was regarded
as a very special plus. For it was hoped that this would enable us to win
the affection, particularly of the smaller nations, and the confidence of
the large ones the more easily.It did not occur to us that our honesty was a profound horror
to the others, if for no other reason because we ourselves believed all
these things seriously while the rest of the world regarded such behavior
as the expression of a special slyness and disingenuousness, until, to their
great, infinite amazement, the revolution gave them a deeper insight into
the boundless stupidity of our honest convictions.However, the absurdity of this 'economic conquest' at once made
the absurdity of the Triple Alliance clear and comprehensible. For with
what other state could we ally ourselves? In alliance with Austria, to be
sure, we could not undertake any military conquest, even in Europe alone.
Precisely therein consisted the inner weakness of the alliance from the
very first day. A Bismarck could permit himself this makeshift, but not
by a long shot every bungling successor, least of all at a time when certain
essential premises of Bismarck's alliance had long ceased to exist; for
Bismarck still believed that in Austria he had to do with a German state.
But with the gradual introduction of universal suffrage, this country had
sunk to the status of an unGerman hodgepodge with a parliamentary government.Also from the standpoint of racial policy, the alliance with
Austria was simply ruinous. It meant tolerating the growth of a new Slavic
power on the borders of the Reich, a power which sooner or later would have
to take an entirely different attitude toward Germany than, for example,
Russia. And from year to year the alliance itself was bound to grow inwardly
hollower and weaker in proportion as the sole supporters of this idea in
the monarchy lost influence and were shoved out of the most decisive positions.By the turn of the century the alliance with Austria had entered
the very same stage as Austria's pact with Italy.Here again there were only two possibilities: either we were
in a pact with the Habsburg monarchy or we had to lodge protest against
the repression of Germanism. But once a power embarks on this kind of undertaking,
it usually ends in open struggle.Even psychologically the value of the Triple Alliance was small,
since the stability of an alliance increases in proportion as the individual
contracting parties can hope to achieve definite and tangible expansive
aims. And, conversely, it will be the weaker the more it limits itself to
the preservation of an existing condition. Here, as everywhere else, strength
lies not in defense but in attack.Even then this was recognized in various quarters, unfortunately
not by the so-called 'authorities.' Particularly Ludendorff, then a colonel
and officer in the great general staff, pointed to these weaknesses in a
memorial written in 1912. Of course, none of the 'statesmen' attached any
value or significance to the matter; for clear common sense is expected
to manifest itself expediently only in common mortals, but may on principle
remain absent where 'diplomats' are concenned.For Germany it was sheer good fortune that in 1914 the war broke
out indirectly through Austria, so that the Habsburgs were forced to take
part; for if it had happened the other way around Germany would have been
alone. Never would the Habsburg state have been able, let alone willing,
to take part in a confiict which would have arisen through Germany. What
we later so condemned in Italy would then have happened even earlier with
Austria: they would have remained 'neutral' in order at least to save the
state from a revolution at the very start. Austrian Slavdom would rather
have shattered the monarchy even in 1914 than permit aid to Germany.How great were the dangers and difficulties entailed by the
alliance with the Danubian monarchy, only very few realized a' that time.In the first place, Austria possessed too many enemies who were
planning to grab what they could from the rotten state to prevent a certain
hatred from arising in the course of time against Germany, in whom they
saw the cause of preventing the generally hoped and longed-for collapse
of the monarchy. They came to the conviction that Vienna could finally be
reached only by a detour through Berlin.In the second place, Germany thus lost her best and most hopeful
possibilities of alliance. They were replaced by an evermounting tension
with Russia and even Italy. For in Rome the general mood was just as pro-German
as it was antiAustrian, slumbering in the heart of the very last Italian
and often brightly flanng up.Now, since we had thrown ourselves into a policy of commerce
and industry, there was no longer the slightest ground for war against Russia
either. Only the enemies of both nations could still have an active interest
in it. And actually these were primarily the Jews and the Marxists, who,
with every means, incited and agitated for war between the two states.Thirdly and lastly, this alliance inevitably involved an infinite
peril for Germany, because a great power actually hostile to Bismarck's
Reich could at any time easily succeed in mobilizing a whole series of states
against Germany, since it was in a position to promise each of them enrichment
at the expense of our Austrian ally.The whole East of Europe could be stirred up against the Danubian
monarchy-particularly Russia and Italy. Never would the world coalition
which had been forming since the initiating efforts of King Edward have
come into existence if Austria as Germany's ally had not represented too
tempting a legacy. This alone made it possible to bring states with otherwise
so heterogeneous desires and aims into a single offensive front. Each one
could hope that in case of a general action against Germany it, too, would
achieve enrichment at Austria's expense. The danger was enormously increased
by the fact that Turkey seemed to be a silent partner in this unfortunate
alliance.International Jewish world finance needed these lures to enable
it to carry out its long-desired plan for destroying the Germany which thus
far did not submit to its widespread superst3te control of finance and economics.
Only in this way could they forge a coalition made strong and courageous
by the sheer numbers of the gigantic armies now on the march and prepared
to attack the horny Siegfried at last.The alliance with the Habsburg monarchy, which even in Austria
had filled me with dissatisfaction, now became the source of long inner
trials which in the time to come reinforced me even more in the opinion
I had already conceived.Even then, among those few people whom I frequented I made no
secret of my conviction that our catastrophic alliance with a state on the
brink of ruin would also lead to a fatal collapse of Germany unless we knew
enough to release ourselves from it on time. This conviction of mine was
firm as a rock, and I did not falter ill it for one moment when at last
the storm of the World War seemed to have excluded all reasonable thought
and a frenzy of enthusiasm had seized even those quarters for which there
should have been only the coldest consideration of reality. And while I
myself was at the front, I put forwards whenever these problems were discussed,
my opinion that the alliance had to be broken off, the quicker the better
for the German nation, and that the sacrifice of the Habsburg monarchy would
be no sacrifice at all to make if Germany thereby could achieve a restriction
of her adversaries; for it was not for the preservation of a debauched dynasty
that the millions had donned the steel helmet, but for the salvation of
the German nation.On a few occasions before the War it seemed as though, in one
camp at least, a gentle doubt was arising as to the correctness of the alliance
policy that had been chosen. German conservative circles began from time
to time to warn against excessive confidence, but, like everything else
that was sensible, this was thrown to the winds. They were convinced that
they were on the path to a world ' conquest,' whose success would be tremendous
and which would entail practically no sacrifices.There was nothing for those not in authority to do but to watch
in silence why and how the ' authorities' marched straight to destruction,
drawing the dear people behind them like the Pied Piper of Hamelin.The deeper cause that made it possible to represent the absurdity
of an ' economic conquest ' as a practical political method, and the preservation
of 'world peace' as a political goal for a whole people, and even to make
these things intelligible, lay in the general sickening of our whole political
thinking.With the victorious march of German technology and industry,
the rising successes of German commerce, the realization was increasingly
lost that all this was only possible on the basis of a strong state. On
the contrary, many circles went so far as to put forward the conviction
that the state owed its very existence to these phenomena, that the state
itself Drimarilv represented an economic institution, that it could be governed
according to economic requirements, and that its very existence depended
on economics, a state of affairs which was regarded and glorified as by
far the healthiest and most natural.But the state has nothing at all to do with any definite economic
conception or development.It is not a collection of economic contracting parties in a
definite delimited living space for the fulfillment of economic tasks, but
the organization of a community of physically and psychologically similar
living beings for the better facilitation of the maintenance of their species
and the achievement of the aim which has been allotted to this species by
Providence. This and nothing else is the aim and meaning of a state. Economics
is only one of the many instruments required for the achievement of this
aim. It is never the cause or the aim of a state unless this state is based
on a false, because unnatural, foundation to begin with. Only in this way
can it be explained that the state as such does not necessarily presuppose
territorial limitation. This will be necessary only among the peoples who
want to secure the maintenance of their national comrades by their own resources;
in other words, are prepared to fight the struggle for existence by their
own labor. Peoples who can sneak their way into the rest of mankind like
drones, to make other men work for them under all sorts of pretexts, can
form states even without any definitely delimited living space of their
own. This applies first and foremost to a people under whose parasitism
the whole of honest humanity is suffering, today more than ever: the Jews.The Jewish state was never spatially limited in itself, but
universally unlimited as to space, though restricted in the sense of embracing
but one race. Consequently, this people has always formed a state within
states. It is one of the most ingenious tricks that was ever devised, to
make this state sail under the fiag of 'religion,' thus assuring it of the
tolerance which the Aryan is always ready to accord a religious creed. For
actually the Mosaic religion is nothing other than a doctrine for the preservation
of the Jewish race. It therefore embraces almost all sociological, political,
and economic fields of knowledge which can have any bearing on this function.The urge to preserve the species is the first cause for the
formation of human communities; thus the state is a national organism and
not an economic organization. A difference which is just as large as it
is incomprehensible, particularly to our so-called ' statesmen ' of today.
That is why they think they can build up the state through economics while
in reality it results and always will result solely from the action of those
qualities which lie in line with the will to preserve the species and race.
And these are always heroic virtues and never the egoism of shopkeepers,
since the preservation of the existence of a species presupposes a spirit
of sacrifice in the individual. The sense of the poet's words, 'If you will
not stake your life, you will win no life,' is that the sacrifice of personal
existence is necessary to secure the preservation of the species. Thus,
the most sensible prerequisite for the formation and preservation of a state
is the presence of a certain feeling of cohesion based on similarity of
nature and species, and a willingness to stake everything on it with all
possible means, something which in peoples with soil of their own will create
heroic virtues, but in parasites will create lying hypocrisy and malignant
cruelty, or else these qualities must already be present as the necessary
and demonstrable basis for their existence as a state so different in form.
The formation of a state, originally at least, will occur through the exercise
of these qualities, and in the subsequent struggle for self-preservation
those nations will be defeated- that is, will fall a prey to subjugation
and thus sooner or later die out which in the mutual struggle possess the
smallest share of heroic virtues, or are not equal to the lies and trickery
of the hostile parasite. But in this case, too, this must almost always
be attributed less to a lack of astuteness than to a lack of determination
and courage, which only tries to conceal itself beneath a cloak of humane
convictions.How little the state-forming and state-preserving qualities
are connected with economics is most clearly shown by the fact that the
inner strength of a state only in the rarest cases coincides with so-called
economic prosperity, but that the latter, in innumerable cases, seems to
indicate the state's approaching decline. If the formation of human societies
were primarily attributable to economic forces or even impulses, the highest
economic development would have to mean the greatest strength of the state
and not the opposite.Belief in the state-forming and state-preserving power of economics
seems especially incomprehensible when it obtains in a country which in
all things clearly and penetratingly shows the historic reverse. Prussia,
in particular, demonstrates with marvelous sharpness that not material qualities
but ideal virtues alone make possible the formation of a state. Only under
their protection can economic life flourish, until with the collapse of
the pure state-forming faculties the economy collapses too; a process which
we can observe in so terrible and tragic a form right now. The material
interests of man can always thrive best as long as they remain in the shadow
of heroic virtues; but as soon as they attempt to enter the primary sphere
of existence, they destroy the basis for their own existence.
Always when in Germany there was an upsurge of political power, the economic
conditions began to improve; but always when economics became the sole content
of our people's life, stifling the ideal virtues, the state collapsed and
in a short time drew economic life along with it.If, however, we consider the question, what, in reality, are
the state-forming or even state-preserving forces, we can sum them up under
one single head: the ability and will of the individual to sacrifice himself
for the totality. That these virtues have nothing at all to do with economics
can be seen from the simple realization that man never sacrifices himself
for the latter, or, in other words: a man does not die for business, but
only for ideals. Nothing proved the Englishman's superior psychological
knowledge of the popular soul better than the motivation which he gave to
his struggle. While we fought for bread, England fought for 'freedom'; and
not even for her own, no, for that of the small nations. In our country
we laughed at this effrontery, or were enraged at it, and thus only demonstrated
how emptyheaded and stupid the so-called statesmen of Germany had becorne
even before the War. We no longer had the slightest idea concerning the
essence of the force which can lead men to their death of their own free
will and decision.In 1914 as long as the German people thought they were fighting
for ideals, they stood firm; but as soon as they were told to fight for
their daily bread, they preferred to give up the game.And our brilliant 'statesmen' were astonished at this change
in attitude. It never became clear to them that from the moment when a man
begins to fight for an economic interest, he avoids death as much as possible,
since death wo lid forever deprive him of his reward for fighting. Anxiety
for the rescue of her own child makes a heroine of even the feeblest mother,
and only the struggle for the preservation of the species and the hearth,
or the state that protects it, has at all times driven men against the spears
of their enemies.The following theorem may be established as an eternally valid
truth:Never yet has a state been founded by peaceful economic means,
but always and exclusively by the instincts of preservation of the species
regardless whether these are found in the province of heroic virtue or of
cunning craftiness; the one results in Aryan states based on work and culture,
the other in Jewish colonies of parasites. As soon as economics as such
begins to choke out these Instincts in a people or in a state, it becomes
the seductive cause of subjugation and oppression.The belief of pre-war days that the world could be peacefully
opened up to, let alone conquered for, the German people by a commercial
and colonial policy was a classic sign of the loss of real state-forming
and state-preserving virtues and of all the insight, will power, and active
determination which follow from them; the penalty for this, inevitable as
the law of nature, was the World War with its consequences.For those who do not look more deeply into the matter, this
attitude of the German nation-for it was really as good as general-could
only represent an insoluble riddle: for was not Germany above all other
countries a marvelous example of an empire which had risen from foundations
of pure political power? Prussia, the germ-cell of the Empire, came into
being through resplendent heroism and not through financial operations or
commercial deals, and the Reich itself in turn was only the glorious reward
of aggressive political leadership and the death defying courage of its
soldiers. How could this very German people have succumbed to such a sickening
of its political instinct? For here we face, not an isolated phenomenon,
but forces of decay which in truly terrifying number soon began to flare
up like will-o'-the-wisps, brushing up and down the body politic, or eating
like poisonous abscesses into the nation, now here and now there. It seemed
as though a continuous stream of poison was being driven into the outermost
blood-vessels of this once heroic body by a mysterious power, and was inducing
progressively greater paralysis of sound reason and the simple instinct
of selfpreservation .As innumerable times I passed in review all these questions,
arising through my position on the German alliance policy and the economic
policy of the Reich in the years 1912 to 1914-the only remaining solution
to the riddle became to an ever-increasing degree that power which, from
an entirely different viewpoint, I had come to know earlier in Vienna: the
Marxist doctrine and philosophy, and their organizational results.For the second time I dug into this doctrine of destruction-
this time no longer led by the impressions and effects of my daily associations,
but directed by the observation of general processes of political life.
I again immersed myself in the theoretical literature of this new world,
attempting to achieve clarity concerning its possible effects, and then
compared it with the actual phenomena and events it brings about in political,
cultural, and economic life.Now for the first time I turned my attention to the attempts
to master this world plague.I studied Bismarck's Socialist legislation 1 in its intention
struggle, and success. Gradually I obtained a positively granite foundation
for my own conviction, so that since that time I have never been forced
to undertake a shift in my own inner view on this question. Likewise the
relation of Marxism to the Jews was submitted to further thorough examination.Though previously in Vienna, Germany above all had seemed to
me an unshakable colossus, now anxious misgivings sometimes entered my mind.
In silent solitude and in the small circles of my acquaintance, I was filled
with wrath at German foreign policy and likewise with what seemed to me
the incredibly frivolous way in which the most important problem then existing
for Germany, Marxism, was treated. It was really beyond me how people could
rush so blindly into a danger whose effects, pursuant to the Marxists' own
intention, were bound some day to be monstrous. Even then, among my acquaintance,
just as today on a large scale, I warned against the phrase with which all
wretched cowards comfort themselves: 'Nothing can happen to us!' This pestilential
attitude had once been the downfall of a gigantic empire. Could anyone believe
that Germany alone was not subject to exactly the same laws as all other
human organisms?In the years 1913 and 1914, I, for the first time in various
circles which today in part faithfully support the National Socialist movement,
expressed the conviction that the question of the future of the German nation
was the question of destroying Marxism.In the catastrophic German alliance policy I saw only one of
the consequences called forth by the disruptive work of this doctrine; for
the terrible part of it was that this poison almost invisibly destroyed
all the foundations of a healthy conception of economy and state, and that
often those affected by it did not themselves realize to what an extent
their activities and desires emanated from this philosophy srhich they otherwise
sharply ejected.The internal decline of the German nation had long since begun,
yet, as so often in life, people had not achieved clarity concerning the
force that was destroying their existence. Sometimes they tinkered around
with the disease, but confused the forms of the phenomenon with the virus
that had caused it. Since they did not know or want to know the cause, the
struggle against Malsisrs was no better than bungling quackery.


As A YOUNG SCAMP in my wild years, nothing had so grieved me
as having been born at a time which obviously erected its Halls of Fame
only to shopkeepers and government officials. The waves of historic events
seemed to have grown so smooth that the future really seemed to belong only
to the 'peaceful contest of nations'; in other words, a cozy mutual swindling
match with the exclusion of violent methods of defense. The various nations
began to be more and more like private citizens who cut the ground from
under one another's feet, stealing each other's customers and orders, trying
in every way to get ahead of one another, and staging this whole act amid
a hue and cry as loud as it is harmless. This development seemed not only
to endure but was expected in time (as was universally recommended) to remodel
the whole world into one big department store in whose vestibules the busts
of the shrewdest profiteers and the most lamblike administrative officials
would be garnered for all eternity. The English could supply the merchants,
the Germans the administrative officials, and the Jews no doubt would have
to sacrifice themselves to being the owners, since by their own admission
they never make any money, but always 'pay,' and, besides, speak the most
languages.Why couldn't I have been born a hundred years earlier? Say at
the time of the Wars of Liberation when a man, even without a 'business,'
was really worth something?!Thus I had often indulged in angry thoughts concerning my earthly
pilgrimage, which, as it seemed to me, had begun too late, and regarded
the period 'of law and order' ahead of me as a mean and undeserved trick
of Fate. Even as a boy I was no 'pacifist,' and all attempts to educate
me in this direction came to nothing.The Boer War was like summer lightning to me.Every day I waited impatiently for the newspapers and devoured
dispatches and news reports, happy at the privilege of witnessing this heroic
struggle even at a distance.The Russo-Japanese War found me considerably more mature, but
also more attentive. More for national reasons I had already taken sides,
and in our little discussions at once sided with the Japanese. In a defeat
of the Russians I saw the defeat of Austrian Slavdom.Since then many years have passed, and what as a boy had seemed
to me a lingering disease, I now felt to be the quiet before the storm.
As early as my Vienna period, the Balkans were immersed in that livid sultriness
which customarily announces the hurricane, and from time to time a beam
of brighter light flared up, only to vanish again in the spectral darkness.
But then came the Balkan War and with it the first gust of wind swept across
a Europe grown nervous. The time which now followed lay on the chests of
men like a heavy nightmare, sultry as feverish tropic heat, so that due
to constant anxiety the sense of approaching catastrophe turned at last
to longing: let Heaven at last give free rein to the fate which could no
longer be thwarted. And then the first mighty lightning flash struck the
earth; the storm was unleashed and with the thunder of Heaven there mingled
the roar of the World War batteries.When the news of the murder of Archduke Francis Ferdinand arrived
in Munich (I happened to be sitting at home and heard of it only- vaguely),
I was at first seized with worry that the bullets may have been shot from
the pistols of German students, who, out of indignation at the heir apparent's
continuous work of Slavization, wanted to free the German people from this
internal enemy. What the consequence of this would have been was easy to
imagine: a new wave of persecutions which would now have been 'justified'
and 'explained' in the eyes of the whole world. But when, soon afterward,
I heard the names of the supposed assassins, and moreover read that they
had been identified as Serbs, a light shudder began to run through me at
this vengeance of inscrutable Destiny.The greatest friend of the Slavs had fallen beneath the bullets
of Slavic fanatics.Anyone with constant occasion in the last years to observe the
relation of Austria to Serbia could not for a moment be in doubt that a
stone had been set rolling whose course could no longer be arrested.Those who today shower the Viennese government with reproaches
on the form and content of the ultimatum it issued, do it an injustice.
No other power in the world could have acted differently in the same situation
and the same position. At her southeastern border Austria possessed an inexorable
and mortal enemy who at shorter and shorter intervals kept challenging the
monarchy and would never have left off until the moment favorable for the
shattering of the Empire had arrived. There was reason to fear that this
would occur at the latest with the death of the old Emperor; by then perhaps
the old monarchy would no longer be in a position to offer any serious resistance.
In the last few years the state had been so bound up with the person of
Francis Joseph that the death of this old embodiment of the Empire was felt
by the broad masses to be tantamount to the death of the Empire itself.
Indeed, it was one of the craftiest artifices, particularly of the Slavic
policy, to create the appearance that the Austrian state no longer owed
its existence to anything but the miraculous and unique skill of this monarch;
this flattery was all the more welcome in the Hofburg, since it corresponded
not at all to the real merits of the Emperor. The thorn hidden in these
paeans of praise remained undiscovered The rulers did not see, or perhaps
no longer wanted to see, that the more the monarchy depended on the outstanding
statecraft, as they put it, of this 'wisest monarch' of all times, the more
catastrophic the situation was bound to become if one day Fate were to knock
at his door, too, demanding its tribute.Was old Austria even conceivable without the Emperor?!Wouldn't the tragedy which had once stricken Maria Theresa have
been repeated?No, it is really doing the Vienna circles an injustice to reproach
them with rushing into a war which might otherwise have been avoided. It
no longer could be avoided, but at most could have been postponed for one
or two years. But this was the curse of German as well as Austrian diplomacy,
that it had always striven to postpone the inevitable reckoning, until at
length it was forced to strike at the most unfavorable hour. We can be convinced
that a further attempt to save peace would have brought war at an even more
unfavorable time.No, those who did not want this war had to have the courage
to face the consequences, which could have consisted only in the sacrifice
of Austria. Even then the war would have come, but no longer as a struggle
of all against ourselves, but in the form of a partition of the Habsburg
monarchy. And then they had to make up their minds to join in, or to look
on with empty hands and let Fate run its course.Those very people, however, who today are loudest in cursing
the beginning of the war and offer the sagest opinions were those who contributed
most fatally to steering us into it.For decades the Social Democrats had carried on the most scoundrelly
war agitation against Russia, and the Center for religious reasons had been
most active in making the Austrian state the hinge and pivot of Germany
policy. Now we had to suffer the consequences of this lunacy. What came
had to come, and could no longer under any circumstances be avoided. The
guilt of the German government was that in order to preserve peace it always
missed the favorable hours for striking, became entangled in the alliance
for the preservation of world peace, and thus finally became the victim
of a world coalition which countered the idea of preserving world peace
with nothing less than determination for world war.If the Vienna government had given the ultimatum another milder
form, this would have changed nothing in the situation except at most one
thing, that this government would itself have been swept away by the indignation
of the people. For in the eyes of the broad masses the tone of the ultimatum
was far too gentle and by no means too brutal, let alone too far-reaching
Anyone who today attempts to argue this away is either a forgetful blockhead
or a perfectly conscious swindler and liarThe struggle of the year 1914 was not forced on the masses-
no, by the living God-it was desired by the whole people.People wanted at length to put an end to the general uncertainty.
Only thus can it be understood that more than two million German men and
boys thronged to the colors for this hardest of all struggles, prepared
to defend the flag with the last drop of their blood.To me those hours seemed like a release from the painful
feelings of my youth. Even today I am not ashamed to say that, overpowered
by stormy enthusiasm, I fell down on my knees and thanked Heaven from an
overflowing heart for granting me the good fortune of being permitted to
live at this time.A fight for freedom had begun, mightier than the earth had ever
seen; for once Destiny had begun its course, the conviction dawned on even
the broad masses that this time not the fate of Serbia or Austria was involved,
but whether the German nation was to be or not to be.For the last time in many years the people had a prophetic vision
of its own future. Thus, right at the beginning of the gigantic struggle
the necessary grave undertone entered into the ecstasy- of an overflowing
enthusiasm; for this knowledge alone made the national uprising more than
a mere blaze of straw The earnestness was only too necessary; for in those
days people in general had not the faintest conception of the possible length
and duration of the struggle that was now beginning. They dreamed of being
home again that winter to continue and renew their peaceful labors.What a man wants is what he hopes and believes. The overwhelming
majority of the nation had long been weary of the eternally uncertain state
of affairs; thus it was only too understandable that they no longer believed
in a peaceful conclusion of the Austro-Serbian convict, but hoped for the
final settlement.I, too, was one of these millions.Hardly had the news of the assassination become known in Munich
than at once two thoughts quivered through my brain: first, that at last
war would be inevitable; and, furthermore, that now the Habsburg state would
be compelled to keep its pact; for what I had always most feared was the
possibility that Germany herself would some day, perhaps in consequence
of this very alliance, find herself in a conflict not directly caused by
Austria, so that the Austrian state for reasons of domestic policy would
not muster the force of decision to stand behind her ally. The Slavic majority
of the Empire would at once have begun to sabotage any such intention on
the part of the state, and would always have preferred to smash the entire
state to smithereens than grant its ally the help it demanded. This danger
was now eliminated. The old state had to fight whether it wanted to or not.My own position on the conflict was likewise very simple and
clear; for me it was not that Austria was fighting for some Serbian satisfaction,
but that Germany was fighting for her existence, the German nation for life
or death, freedom and future. The time had come for Bismarck's work to fight;
what the fathers had once won in the battles from Weissenburg to Sedan and
Paris, young Germany now had to earn once more. If the struggle were carried
through to victory, our nation would enter the circle of great nations from
the standpoint of external power, and only then could the German Reich maintain
itself as a mighty haven of peace without having, for the sake of peace,
to cut down on the daily bread of her children.As a boy and young man I had so often felt the desire to prove
at least once by deeds that for me national enthusiasm was no empty whim.
It often seemed to me almost a sin to shout hurrah perhaps without having
the inner right to do so; for who had the right to use this word without
having proved it in the place where all playing is at an end and the inexorable
hand of the Goddess of Destiny begins to weigh peoples and men according
to the truth and steadfastness of their convictions? Thus my heart, like
that of a million others, overflowed with proud joy that at last I would
be able to redeem myself from this paralyzing feeling. I had so often sung
'Deutschland uber Aloes' and shouted Neil ' at the top of my lungs, that
it seemed to me almost a belated act of grace to be allowed to stand as
a witness in the divine court of the eternal judge and proclaim the sincerity
of this conviction. For from the first hour r was convinced that in case
of a war- which seemed to me inevitable-in one way or another I would at
once leave my books. Likewise I knew that my place would then be where my
inner voice directed me.I had left Austria primarily for political reasons; what was
more natural than that, now the struggle had begun, I should really begin
to take account of this conviction. I did not want to fight for the Habsburg
state, but was ready at any time to die for my people and for the Reich
which embodied itOn the third of August, I submitted a personal petition to His
Majesty, lying Ludwig III, with a request for permission to enter a Bavarian
regiment. The cabinet office certainly had plenty to do in those days; so
much the greater was my joy to receive an answer to my request the very
next day. With trembling hands I opened the document; my request had been
approved and I was summoned to report to a Bavarian regiment. My joy and
gratitude knew no bounds. A few days later I was wearing the tunic which
I was not to doff until nearly six years later.For me, as for every German, there now began the greatest and
most unforgettable time of my earthly existence. Compared to the events
of this gigantic struggle, everything past receded to shallow nothingness.
Precisely in these days, with the tenth anniversary of the mighty event
approaching, I think back with proud sadness on those first weeks of our
people's heroic struggle, in which Fate graciously allowed me to take part.As though it were yesterday, image after image passes before
my eyes. I see myself donning the uniform in the circle of my dear comrades,
turning out for the first time, drilling, etc., until the day came for us
to march off.A single worry tormented me at that time, me, as so many others:
would we not reach the front too late? Time and time again this alone banished
all my calm. Thus, in every cause for rejoicing at a new, heroic victory,
a slight drop of bitterness was hidden, for every new victory seemed to
increase the danger of our coming too late.At last the day came when we left Munich to begin the fulfillment
of our duty. For the first time I saw the Rhine as we rode westward along
its quiet waters to defend it, the German stream of streams, from the greed
of the old enemy. When through the tender veil of the early morning mist
the Niederwald Monument gleamed down upon us in the gentle first rays of
the sun, the old Watch on the Rhine roared out of the endless transport
train into the morning sky, and I felt as though my heart would burst.And then came a damp, cold night in Flanders, through which
we marched in silence, and when the day began to emerge from the mists,
suddenly an iron greeting came whizzing at us over our heads, and with a
sharp report sent the little pellets flying between our ranks, ripping up
the wet ground; but even before the little cloud had passed, from two hundred
throats the first hurrah rose to meet the first messenger of death. Then
a crackling and a roaring, a singing and a howling began, and with feverish
eyes each one of us was drawn forward, faster and faster, until suddenly
past turnip fields and hedges the fight began, the fight of man against
man. And from the distance the strains of a song reached our ears, coming
closer and closer, leaping from company to company, and just as Death plunged
a busy hand into our ranks, the song reached us too and we passed it along:
'Deutschland, Deutschland uber Alles, uber Alles in der Welt!'Four days later we came back. Even our step had changed. Seventeen-year-old
boys now looked like men.The volunteers of the List Regiment may not have learned to
fight properly, but they knew how to die like old soldiersThis was the beginning.Thus it went on year after year; but the romance of battle had
been replaced by horror. The enthusiasm gradually cooled and the exuberant
joy was stifled by mortal fear. The time came when every man had to struggle
between the instinct of self-preservation and the admonitions of duty. I,
too, was not spared by this struggle. Always when Death was on the hunt,
a vague something tried to revolt, strove to represent itself to the weak
body as reason, yet it was only cowardice, which in such disguises tried
to ensnare the individual. A grave tugging and warning set in, and often
it was only the last remnant of conscience which decided the issue. Yet
the more this voice admonished one to caution, the louder and more insistent
its lures, the sharper resistance grew until at last, after a long inner
struggle, consciousness of duty emerged victorious. By the winter of 1915-16
this struggle had for me been decided. At last my will was undisputed master.
If in the first days I went over the top with rejoicing and laughter, I
was now calm and determined. And this was enduring. Now Fate could bring
on the ultimate tests without my nerves shattering or my reason failing.The young volunteer had become an old soldier.And this transformation had occurred in the whole army. It had
issued old and hard from the eternal battles, and as for those who could
not stand up under the storm-well, they were broken.Now was the time to judge this army. Now, after two or three
years, during which it was hurled from one battle into another, forever
fighting against superiority in numbers and weapons, suffering hunger and
bearing privations, now was the time to test the quality of this unique
army.Thousands of years may pass, but never will it be possible to
speak of heroism without mentioning the German army and the World War. Then
from the veil of the past the iron front of the gray steel helmet will emerge,
unwavering and unflinching, an immortal monument. As long as there are Germans
alive, they will remember that these men were sons of their nation.I was a soldier then, and I didn't want to talk about politics.
And really it was not the time for it. Even today I harbor the conviction
that the humblest wagon-driver performed more valuable services for the
fatherland than the foremost among, let us say, 'parliamentarians.' I had
never hated these bigmouths more than now when every red-blooded man with
something to say yelled it into the enemy's face or appropriately left his
tongue at home and silently did his duty somewhere. Yes, in those days I
hated all those politicians. And if it had been up to me, a parliamentary
pick-and-shovel battalion would have been formed at once; then they could
have chewed the fat to their hearts' content without annoying, let alone
harming, honest, decent people.Thus, at that time I wanted to hear nothing of politics, but
I could not help taking a position on certain manifestations which after
all did affect the whole nations and particularly concerned us soldiers.There were two things which then profoundly angered me and which
I regarded as harmful.After the very first news of victories, a certain section of
the press, slowly, and in a way which at first was perhaps unrecognizable
to many, began to pour a few drops of wormwood into the general enthusiasm.
This was done beneath the mask of a certain benevolence and well-meaning,
even of a certain solicitude. They had misgivings about an excess of exuberance
in the celebration of the victories. They feared that in this form it was
unworthy of so great a nation and hence inappropriate. The bravery and heroic
courage of the German soldier were something self-evident, they said, and
people should not be carried away too much by thoughtless outbursts of joy,
if only for the sake of foreign countries to whom a silent and dignified
form of joy appealed more than unbridled exultation, etc. Finally, we Germans
even now should not forget that the war was none of our intention and therefore
we should not be ashamed to confess in an open and manly fashion that at
any time we would contribute our part to a reconciliation of mankind. For
that reason it would not be prudent to besmirch the purity of our army's
deeds by too much shouting, since the rest of the world would have little
understanding for such behavior. The world admired nothing more than the
modesty with which a true hero silently and calmly forgets his deeds, for
this was the gist of the whole argument.Instead of taking one of these creatures by his long ears, tying
him to a long pole and pulling him up on a long cord, thus making it impossible
for the cheering nation to insult the aesthetic sentiment of this knight
of the inkpot, the authorities actually began to issue remonstrances against
' unseemly ' rejoicing over victories.It didn't occur to them in the least that enthusiasm once scotched
cannot be reawakened at need. It is an intoxication and must be preserved
in this state. And how, without this power of enthusiasm, should a country
withstand a struggle which in all likelihood would make the most enormous
demands on the spiritual qualities of the nation?I knew the psyche of the broad masses too well not to be aware
that a high 'aesthetic' tone would not stir up the fire that was necessary
to keep the iron hot. In my eyes it was madness on the part of the authorities
to be doing nothing to intensify the glowing heat of passion; and when they
curtailed what passion was fortunately present, that was absolutely beyond
me.The second thing that angered me was the attitude which they
thought fit to take toward Marxism. In my eyes, this only proved that they
hadn't so much as the faintest idea concerning this pestilence. In all seriousness
they seemed to believe that, by the assurance that parties were no longer
recognized, they had brought Marxism to understanding and restraint.They failed to understand that here no party was involved, but
a doctrine that must lead to the destruction of all humanity, especially
since this cannot be learned in the Jewified universities and, besides,
so many, particularly among our higher officials, due to the idiotic conceit
that is cultivated in them, don't think it worth the trouble to pick up
a book and learn something which was not in their university curriculum.
The most gigantic upheaval passes these 'minds' by without leaving the slightest
trace, which is why state institutions for the most part lag behind private
ones. It is to them, by God, that the popular proverb best applies: 'What
the peasant doesn't know, he won't eat.' Here, too, a few exceptions only
confirm the rule.It was an unequaled absurdity to identify the German worker
with Marxism in the days of August, 1914. In those hours the German worker
had made himself free from the embrace of this venomous plague, for otherwise
he would never have been able to enter the struggle. The authorities, however,
were stupid enough to believe that Marxism had now become national; a flash
of genius which only shows that in these long years none of these official
guides of the state had even taken the trouble to study the essence of this
doctrine, for if they had, such an absurdity could scarcely have crept in.Marxism, whose goal is and remains the destruction of all non-Jewish
national states, was forced to look on in horror as, in the July days of
1914, the German working class it had ensnared, awakened and from hour to
hour began to enter the service of the fatherland with ever-increasing rapidity.
In a few days the whole mist and swindle of this infamous betrayal of the
people had scattered away, and suddenly the gang of Jewish leaders stood
there lonely and forsaken, as though not a trace remained of the nonsense
and madness which for sixty years they had been funneling into the masses.
It was a bad moment for the betrayers of the German working class, but as
soon as the leaders recognized the danger which menaced them, they rapidly
pulled the tarn-cap ' of lies over their ears, and insolently mimicked the
national awakening.But now the time had come to take steps against the whole treacherous
brotherhood of they Jewish poisoners of the people. Now was the time to
deal with them summarily without the slightest consideration for any screams
and complaints that might arise. In August, 1914, the whole Jewish jabber
about international solidarity had vanished at one stroke from the heads
of the German working class, and in its stead, only a few weeks later, American
shrapnel began to pour down the blessings of brotherhood on the helmets
of our march columns. It would have been the duty of a serious government,
now that the German worker had found his way back to his nation, to exterminate
mercilessly the agitators who were misleading the nation.If the best men were dying at the front, the least we could
do was to wipe out the vermin.
Instead of this, His Majesty the Raiser himself stretched out his hand to
the old criminals, thus sparing the treacherous murderers of the nation
and giving them a chance to retrieve themselves.So nova the viper could continue his work, more cautiously than
before, but all the more dangerously. While the honest ones were dreaming
of peace within their borders,l the perjuring criminals were organizing
the revolution.That such terrible half-measures should then be decided upon
made me more and more dissatisfied at heart; but at that time I would not
have thought it possible that the end of it all would be so frightful.What, then, should have been done? The leaders of the whole
movement should at once have been put behind bars, brought to trial, and
thus taken off the nation's neck. All the implements of military power should
have been ruthlessly used for the extermination of this pestilence. The
parties should have been dissolved, the Reichstag brought to its senses,
with bayonets if necessary, but, best of all, dissolved at once. Just as
the Republic today can dissolve parties, this method should have been used
at that time, with more reason. For the life and death of a whole nation
was at stake!One question came to the fore, however: can spiritual ideas
be exterminated by the sword? Can 'philosophies' be combated by the use
of brute force?Even at that time I pondered this question more than once: If
we ponder analogous cases, particularly on a religious basis, which can
be found in history, the following fundamental principle emerges:Conceptions and ideas, as well as movements with a definite
spiritual foundation, regardless whether the latter is false or true, can,
after a certain point in their development, only be broken with technical
instruments of power if these physical weapons are at the same time the
support of a new kindling thought, idea, or philosophy.         The application of force alone, without the impetus of a basic
spiritual idea as a starting point, can never lead to the destruction of
an idea and its dissemination, except in the form of a complete extermination
of even the very last exponent of the idea and the destruction of the last
tradition. This, however, usually means the disappearance of such a state
from the sphere of political importance, often for an indefinite time and
some-times forever; for experience shows that such a blood sacrifice strikes
the best part of the people, since every persecution which occurs without
a spiritual basis seems morally unjustified and whips up precisely the more
valuable parts of a people in protest, which results in an adoption of the
spiritual content of the unjustly persecuted movement. In many this occurs
simply through a feeling of opposition against the attempt to bludgeon down
an idea by brute force.As a result, the number of inward supporters grows in proportion
as the persecution increases. Consequently, the complete annihilation of
the new doctrine can be carried out only through a process of extermination
so great and constantly increasing that in the end all the truly valuable
blood is drawn out of the people or state in question. The consequence is
that, though a so-called 'inner' purge can now take place, it will only
be at the cost of total impotence. Such a method will always prove vain
in advance if the doctrine to be combated has overstepped a certain small
circle.Consequently, here, too, as in all growth, the first period
of childhood is most readily susceptible to the possibility of extermination,
while with the mounting years the power of resistance increases and only
with the weakness of approaching old age cedes again to new youth, though
in another form and for different reasons.Indeed, nearly all attempts to exterminate a doctrine and its
organizational expression, by force without spiritual foundation, are doomed
to failure, and not seldom end with the exact opposite of the desired result
for the following reason:The very first requirement for a mode of struggle with the weapons
of naked force is and remains persistence. In other words: only the continuous
and steady application of the methods for repressing a doctrine, etc., makes
it possible for a plan to succeed. But as soon as force wavers and alternates
with forbearance, not only will the doctrine to be repressed recover again
and again, but it will also be in a position to draw new benefit from every
persecution, since, after such a wave of pressure has ebbed away, indignation
over the suffering induced leads new supporters to the old doctrine, while
the old ones will cling to it with greater defiance and deeper hatred than
before, and even schismatic heretics, once the danger has subsided, will
attempt to return to their old viewpoint. Only in the steady and constant
application of force lies the very first prerequisite for success. This
persistence, however, can always and only arise from a definite spiritual
conviction. Any violence which does not spring from a firm, spiritual base,
will be wavering and uncertain. It lacks the stability which can only rest
in a fanatical outlook. It emanates from the momentary energy and brutal
determination of an individual, and is therefore subject to the change of
personalities and to their nature and strength.Added to this there is something else:Any philosophy, whether of a religious or political nature-
and sometimes the dividing line is hard to determine-fights less for the
negative destruction of the opposing ideology than for the positive promotion
of its own. Hence its struggle is less defensive than offensive. It therefore
has the advantage even in determining the goal, since this goal represents
the victory of its own idea, while, conversely, it is hard to determine
when the negative aim of the destruction of a hostile doctrine may be regarded
as achieved and assured. For this reason alone, the philosophy's offensive
will be more systematic and also more powerful than the defensive against
a philosophy, since here, too, as always, the attack and not the defense
makes the decision. The fight against a spiritual power with methods of
violence remains defensive, however, until the sword becomes the support,
the herald and disseminator, of a new spiritual doctrine.Thus, in summing up, we can establish the following:Any attempt to combat a philosophy with methods of violence
will fail in the end, unless the fight takes the form of attack for a new
spiritual attitude. Only in the struggle between two philosophies can the
weapon of brutal force, persistently and ruthlessly applied lead to a decision
for the side it supports.This remained the reason for the failure of the struggle against
Marxism.This was why Bismarck's Socialist legislation finally failed
and had to fail, in spite of everything. Lacking was the platform of a new
philosophy for whose rise the fight could have been waged. For only the
proverbial wisdom of high government officials will succeed in believing
that drivel about so-called 'state authority' or 'law and order' could form
a suitable basis for the spiritual impetus of a life-and-death struggle.Since a real spiritual basis for this struggle was lacking,
Bismarck had to entrust the execution of his Socialist legislation to the
judgment and desires of that institution which itself was a product of Marxist
thinking. By entrusting the fate of his war on the Marxists to the well-wishing
of bourgeois democracy, the Iron Chancellor set the wolf to mind the sheep.All this was only the necessary consequence of the absence of
a basic new anti-Marxist philosophy endowed with a stormy will to conquer.Hence the sole result of Bismarck's struggle was a grave disillusionment.Were conditions different during the World War or at its beginning?
Unfortunately not.The more I occupied myself with the idea of a necessary change
in the government's attitude toward Social Democracy as the momentary embodiment
of Marxism, the more I recognized the lack of a serviceable substitute for
this doctrine. What would be given the masses if, just supposing, Social
Democracy had been broken? There was not one movement in existence which
could have been expected to succeed in drawing into its sphere of influence
the great multitudes of workers grown more or less leaderless. It is senseless
and more than stupid to believe that the international fanatic who had left
the class party would now at once join a bourgeois party, in other words,
a new class organization. For, unpleasant as it may seem to various organizations,
it cannot be denied that bourgeois politicians largely take class division
quite for granted as long as it does not begin to work out to their political
disadvantage.The denial of this fact only proves the effrontery, and also
the stupidity, of the liars.Altogether, care should be taken not to regard the masses as
stupider than they are. In political matters feeling often decides more
correctly than reason. The opinion that the stupid international attitude
of the masses is sufficient proof of the unsoundness of the masses' sentiments
can be thoroughly confuted by the simple reminder that pacifist democracy
is no less insane, and that its exponents originate almost exclusively in
the bourgeois camp. As long as millions of the bourgeoisie still piously
worship their Jewish democratic press every morning, it very ill becomes
these gentlemen to make jokes about the stupidity of the 'comrade' who,
in the last analysis, only swallows down the same garbage, though in a different
form. In both cases the manufacturer is one and the same Jew.Good care should be taken not to deny things that just happen
to be true. The fact that the class question is by no means exclusively
a matter of ideal problems, as, particularly before the elections, some
people would like to pretend, cannot be denied. The class arrogance of a
large part of our people, and to an even greater extent, the underestimation
of the manual worker, are phenomena which do not exist only in the imagination
of the moonstruck.Quite aside from this, however, it shows the small capacity
for thought of our so-called 'intelligentsia' when, particularly in these
circles, it is not understood that a state of affairs which could not prevent
the growth of a plague, such as Marxism happens to be, will certainly not
be able to recover what has been lost.The 'bourgeois' parties, as they designate themselves, will
never be able to attach the 'proletarian' masses to their camp, for here
two worlds oppose each other, in part naturally and in part artificially
divided, whose mutual relation 1 can only be struggle. The younger will
be victorious-and this is Marxism.Indeed, a struggle against Social Democracy in the year 1914
was conceivable, but how long this condition would be maintained, in view
of the absence of any substitute, remained doubtful.Here there was a great gap.I was of this opinion long before the War, and for this reason
could not make up my mind to join one of the existing parties. In the course
of events of the World War, I was reinforced in this opinion by the obvious
impossibility of taking up a ruthless struggle against Social Democracy,
owing to this very lack of a movement which would have had to be more than
a 'parliamentary' party.With my closer comrades I often expressed myself openly on this
point.And now the first ideas came to me of later engaging in political
activity.Precisely this was what caused me often to assure the small
circle of my friends that after the War, I meant to be a speaker in addition
to my profession.I believe that I was very serious about this.


EVER since I have been scrutinizing political events, I have
taken a tremendous interest in propagandist activity. I saw that the Socialist-Marxist
organizations mastered and applied this instrument with astounding skill.
And I soon realized that the correct use of propaganda is a true art which
has remained practically unknown to the bourgeois parties. Only the Christian-Social
movement, especially in Lueger's time, achieved a certain virtuosity on
this instrument, to which it owed many of its successes.But it was not until the War that it became evident what immense
results could be obtained by a correct application of propaganda. Here again,
unfortunately, all our studying had to be done on the enemy side, for the
activity on our side was modest, to say the least. The total miscarriage
of the German 'enlightenment ' service stared every soldier in the face,
and this spurred me to take up the question of propaganda even more deeply
than before.There was often more than enough time for thinking, and the
enemy offered practical instruction which, to our sorrow, was only too good.For what we failed to do, the enemy did, with amazing skill
and really brilliant calculation. I, myself, learned enormously from this
enemy war propaganda. But time passed and left no trace in the minds of
all those who should have benefited; partly because they considered themselves
too clever to from the enemy, partly owing to lack of good will.Did we have anything you could call propaganda?I regret that I must answer in the negative. Everything that
actually was done in this field was so inadequate and wron
from the very start that it certainly did no good and sometimes did actual
harm.The form was inadequate, the substance was psychologically wrong:
a careful examination of German war propaganda ca: lead to no other diagnosis.There seems to have been no clarity on the very first question:
Is propaganda a means or an end?It is a means and must therefore be judged with regard to its
end. It must consequently take a form calculated to support the aim which
it serves. It is also obvious that its aim can vary in importance from the
standpoint of general need, and that the inner value of the propaganda will
vary accordingly. The aim for which we were fighting the War was the loftiest,
the most overpowering, that man can conceive: it was the freedom and independence
of our nation, the security of our future food supply, and-our national
honor; a thing which, despite all contrary opinions prevailing today, nevertheless
exists, or rather should exist, since peoples without honor have sooner
or later lost their freedom and independence, which in turn is only the
result of a higher justice, since generations of rabble without honor deserve
no freedom. Any man who wants to be a cowardly slave can have no honor)
or honor itself would soon fall into general contempt.The German nation was engaged in a struggle for a human existence,
and the purpose of war propaganda should have been to support this struggle;
its aim to help bring about victory.When the nations on this planet fight for existence-when the
question of destiny, 'to be or not to be,' cries out for a solution-then
all considerations of humanitarianism or aesthetics crumble into nothingness;
for all these concepts do not float about in the ether, they arise from
man's imagination and are bound up with man. When he departs from this world,
these concepts are again dissolved into nothingness, for Nature does not
know them. And even among mankind, they belong only to a few nations or
rather races, and this in proportion as they emanate from the feeling of
the nation or race in question. Humanitarianism and aesthetics would vanish
even from a world inhabited by man if this world were to lose the races
that have created and upheld these concepts.But all such concepts become secondary when a nation is fighting
for its existence; in fact, they become totally irrelevant to the forms
of the struggle as soon as a situation arises where they might paralyze
a struggling nation's power of selfpreservation. And that has always been
their only visible result.As for humanitarianism, Moltke said years ago that in war it
lies in the brevity of the operation, and that means that the most aggressive
fighting technique is the most humane.But when people try to approach these questions with drivel
about aesthetics, etc., really only one answer is possible: where the destiny
and existence of a people are at stake, all obligation toward beauty ceases.
The most unbeautiful thing there can be in human life is and remains the
yoke of slavery. Or do these Schwabing 2 decadents view the present lot
of the German people as 'aesthetic'? Certainly we don't have to discuss
these matters with the Jews, the most modern inventors of this cultural
perfume. Their whole existence is an embodied protest against the aesthetics
of the Lord's image.And since these criteria of humanitarianism and beauty must
be eliminated from the struggle, they are also inapplicable to propaganda.Propaganda in the War was a means to an end, and the end wvas
the struggle for the existence of the German people; consequently, propaganda
could only be considered in accordance with the principles that were valid
for this struggle. In this case the most cruel weapons were humane if they
brought about a quicker victory; and only those methods were beautiful which
helped the nation to safeguard the dignity of its freedom.This was the only possible attitude toward war propaganda in
a life-and-death struggle like ours.If the so-called responsible authorities had been clear on this
point, they would never have fallen into such uncertainty over the form
and application of this weapon: for even propaganda is no more than a weapon,
though a frightful one in the hand of an expert.The second really decisive question was this: To whom should
propaganda be addressed? To the scientifically trained intelligentsia or
to the less educated masses?It must be addressed always and exclusively to the masses.What the intelligentsia-or those who today unfortunately often
go by that name-what they need is not propaganda but scientific instruction.
The content of propaganda is not science any more than the object represented
in a poster is art. The art of the poster lies in the designer's ability
to attract the attention of the crowd by form and color. A poster advertising
an art exhibit must direct the attention of the public to the art being
exhibited; the better it succeeds in this, the greater is the art of the
poster itself. The poster should give the masses an idea of the significance
of the exhibition, it should not be a substitute for the art on display.
Anyone who wants to concern himself with the art itself must do more than
study the poster; and it will not be enough for him just to saunter through
the exhibition. We may expect him to examine and immerse himself in the
individual works, and thus little by little form a fair opinion.A similar situation prevails with what we today call propaganda.The function of propaganda does not lie in the scientific training
of the individual, but in calling the masses' attention to certain facts,
processes, necessities, etc., whose significance is thus for the first time
placed within their field of vision.The whole art consists in doing this so skillfully that everyone
will be convinced that the fact is real, the process necessary, the necessity
correct, etc. But since propaganda is not and cannot be the necessity in
itself, since its function, like the poster, consists in attracting the
attention of the crowd, and not in educating those who are already educated
or who are striving after education and knowledge, its effect for the most
part must be aimed at the emotions and only to a very limited degree at
the so-called intellect.All propaganda must be popular and its intellectual level must
be adjusted to the most limited intelligence among those it is addressed
to. Consequently, the greater the mass it is intended to reach, the lower
its purely intellectual level will have to be. But if, as in propaganda
for sticking out a war, the aim is to influence a whole people, we must
avoid excessive intellectual demands on our public, and too much caution
cannot be exerted in this direction.The more modest its intellectual ballast, the more exclusively
it takes into consideration the emotions of the masses, the more effective
it will be. And this is the best proof of the soundness or unsoundness of
a propaganda campaign, and not success in pleasing a few scholars or young
aesthetes.The art of propaganda lies in understanding the emotional ideas
of the great masses and finding, through a psychologically correct form,
the way to the attention and thence to the heart of the broad masses. The
fact that our bright boys do not understand this merely shows how mentally
lazy and conceited they are.Once we understand how necessary it is for propaganda to be adjusted to the broad mass, the following rule results:



It is a mistake to make propaganda many-sided, like scientific instruction,
for instance.The receptivity of the great masses is very limited, their intelligence
is small, but their power of forgetting is enormous. In consequence of these
facts, all effective propaganda must be limited to a very few points and
must harp on these in sloans until the last member of the public understands
what you want him to understand by your slogan. As soon as you sacrifice
this slogan and try to be many-sided, the effect will piddle away, for the
crowd can neither digest nor retain the material offered. In this way the
result is weakened and in the end entirely cancelled out. Thus we see that propaganda must follow a simple line and correspondingly the basic tactics must be psychologically sound. For instance, it was absolutely wrong to make the enemy ridiculous, as the Austrian and German comic papers did. It was absolutely wrong because actual contact with an enemy soldier was bound to arouse an entirely different conviction, and the results were devastating; for now the German soldier, under the direct impression of the enemy's resistance, felt himself swindled by his propaganda service. His desire to fight, or even to stand film, was not strengthened, but the opposite occurred. His courage flagged.By contrast, the war propaganda of the English and Americans
was psychologically sound. By representing the Germans to their own people
as barbarians and Huns, they prepared the individual soldier for the terrors
of war, and thus helped to preserve him from disappointments. After this,
the most terrible weapon that was used against him seemed only to confirm
what his propagandists had told him; it likewise reinforced his faith in
the truth of his government's assertions, while on the other hand it increased
his rage and hatred against the vile enemy For the cruel effects of the
weapon, whose use by the enemy he now came to know, gradually came to confirm
for him the 'Hunnish' brutality of the barbarous enemy, which he had heard
all about; and it never dawned on him for a moment that his own weapons
possibly, if not probably, might be even more terrible in their effects.And so the English soldier could never feel that he had been
misinformed by his own countrymen, as unhappily was so much the case with
the German soldier that in the end he rejected everything coming from this
source as 'swindles' and 'bunk.' All this resulted from the idea that any
old simpleton (or even somebody who was intelligent ' in other things ')
could be assigned to propaganda work, and the failure to realize that the
most brilliant psychologists would have been none too good.And so the German war propaganda offered an unparalleled example
of an 'enlightenment' service working in reverse, since any correct psychology
was totally lacking.There was no end to what could be learned from the enemy by
a man who kept his eyes open, refused to let his perceptions be ossified,
and for four and a half years privately turned the stormflood of enemy propaganda
over in his brain.What our authorities least of all understood was the very first
axiom of all propagandist activity: to wit, the basically subjective and
one-sided attitude it must take toward every question it deals with. In
this connection, from the very beginning of the War and from top to bottom,
such sins were committed that we were entitled to doubt whether so much
absurdity could really be attributed to pure stupidity alone.What, for example, would we say about a poster that was supposed
to advertise a new soap and that described other soaps as 'good'?We would only shake our heads.Exactly the same applies to political advertising.The function of propaganda is, for example, not to weigh and
ponder the rights of different people, but exclusively to emphasize the
one right which it has set out to argue for. Its task is not to make an
objective study of the truth, in so far as it favors the enemy, and then
set it before the masses with academic fairness; its task is to serve our
own right, always and unflinchingly.It was absolutely wrong to discuss war-guilt from the standpoint
that Germany alone could not be held responsible for the outbreak of the
catastrophe; it would have been correct to load every bit of the blame on
the shoulders of the enemy, even if this had not really corresponded to
the true facts, as it actually did.And what was the consequence of this halfheartedness?The broad mass of a nation does not consist of diplomats, or
even professors of political law, or even individuals capable of forming
a rational opinion; it consists of plain mortals, wavering and inclined
to doubt and uncertainty. As soon as our own propaganda admits so much as
a glimmer of right on the other side, the foundation for doubt in our own
right has been laid. The masses are then in no position to distinguish where
foreign injustice ends and our own begins. In such a case they become uncertain
and suspicious, especially if the enemy refrains from going in for the same
nonsense, but unloads every bit of blame on his adversary. Isn't it perfectly
understandable that the whole country ends up by lending more credence to
enemy propaganda, which is more unified and coherent, than to its own? And
particularly a people that suffers from the mania of objectivity as much
as the Germans. For, after all this, everyone will take the greatest pains
to avoid doing the enemy any injustice, even at the peril of seriously besmirching
and even destroying his own people and country.Of course, this was not the intent of the responsible authorities,
but the people never realize that.The people in their overwhelming majority are so feminine by
nature and attitude that sober reasoning determines their thoughts and actions
far less than emotion and feeling. And this sentiment is not complicated,
but very simple and all of a piece. It does not have multiple shadings;
it has a positive and a negative; love or hate, right or wrong, truth or
lie never half this way and half that way, never partially, or that kind
of thing.English propagandists understood all this most brilliantly-and
acted accordingly. They made no half statements that might have given rise
to doubts.Their brilliant knowledge of the primitive sentiments of the
broad masses is shown by their atrocity propaganda, which was adapted to
this condition. As ruthless as it was brilliant, it created the preconditions
for moral steadfastness at the front, even in the face of the greatest actual
defeats, and just as strikingly it pilloried the German enemy as the sole
guilty party for the outbreak of the War: the rabid, impudent bias and persistence
with which this lie was expressed took into account the emotional, always
extreme, attitude of the great masses and for this reason was believed.How effective this type of propaganda was is most strikingly
shown by the fact that after four years of war it not only enabled the enemy
to stick to its guns, but even began to nibble at our own people.It need not surprise us that our propaganda did not enjoy this
success. In its inner ambiguity alone, it bore the germ of ineffectualness.
And finally its content was such that it was very vunlikely to make the
necessary impression on the masses. Only our feather-brained 'statesmen'
could have dared to hope that this insipid pacifistic bilge could fire men's
spirits till they were willing to die.As a result, their miserable stuff 1 was useless, even harmful
in fact.But the most brilliant propagandist technique will yield no
success unless one fundamental principle is borne in mind constantly and
with unfiagging attention. It must confine itself to a few points and repeat
them over and over. Here, as so often in this world, persistence is the
first and most important requirement for success.Particularly in the field of propaganda, we must never let ourselves
be led by aesthetes or people who have grown blase: not by the former, because
the form and expression of our propaganda would soon, instead of being suitable
for the masses, have drawing power only for literary teas; and of the second
we must beware, because, lacking in any fresh emotion of their own, they
are always on the lookout for new stimulation. These people are quick to
weary of everything; they want variety, and they are never able to feel
or understand the needs of their fellow men who are not yet so callous.
They are always the first to criticize a propaganda campaign, or rather
its content, which seems to them too old-fashioned, too hackneyed, too out-of-date,
etc. They are always after novelty, in search of a change, and this makes
them mortal enemies of any effective political propaganda. For as soon as
the organization and the content of propaganda begin to suit their tastes,
it loses all cohesion and evaporates completely.The purpose of propaganda is not to provide interesting distraction
for blase young gentlemen, but to convince, and what I mean is to convince
the masses. But the masses are slowmoving, and they always require a certain
time before they are ready even to notice a thing, and only after the simplest
ideas are repeated thousands of times will the masses finally remember them.When there is a change, it must not alter the content of what
the propaganda is driving at, but in the end must always say the same thing.
For instance, a slogan must be presented from different angles, but the
end of all remarks must always and immutably be the slogan itself. Only
in this way can the propaganda have a unified and complete effect.This broadness of outline from which we must never depart, in
combination with steady, consistent emphasis, allows our final success to
mature. And then, to our amazement, we shall see what tremendous results
such perseverance leads to-to results that are almost beyond our understanding.All advertising, whether in the field of business or politics,
achieves success through the continuity and sustained uniformity of its
application.Here, too, the example of enemy war propaganda was typical;
limited to a few points, devised exdusively for the masses, carried on with
indefatigable persistence. Once the basic ideas and methods of execution
were recognized as correct, they were applied throughout the whole War without
the slightest change. At first the claims of the propaganda were so impudent
that people thought it insane; later, it got on people's nerves; and in
the end, it was believed. After four and a half years, a revolution broke
out in Germany; and its slogans originated in the enemy's war propaganda.And in England they understood one more thing: that this spiritual
weapon can succeed only if it is applied on a tremendous scale, but that success amply covers all costs.There, propaganda was regarded as a weapon of the first order,
while in our country it was the last resort of unemployed politicians and
a comfortable haven for slackers.And, as was to be expected, its results all in all were zero.


WITH THE YEAR 1915 enemy propaganda began in our country, after
1916 it became more and more intensive, till finally, at the beginning of
the year 1918, it swelled to a positive flood. Now the results of this seduction
could be seen at every step. The army gradually learned to think as the
enemy wanted it to.And the German counter-action was a complete failure.In the person of the man whose intellect and will made him its
leader, the army had the intention and determination to take up the struggle
in this field, too, but it lacked the instrument which would have been necessary.
And from the psychological point of view, it was wrong to have this enlightenment
work carried on by the troops themselves. If it was to be effective, it
had to come from home. Only then was there any assurance of success among
the men who, after all, had been performing immortal deeds of heroism and
privation for nearly four years for this homeland.But what came out of the home country?Was this failure stupidity or crime?In midsummer of 1918, after the evacuation of the southern bank
of the Marne, the German press above all conducted itself with such miserable
awkwardness, nay, criminal stupidity, that my wrath mounted by the day,
and the question arose within me: Is there really no one who can put an
end to this spiritual squandering of the army's heroism?What happened in France in 1914 when we swept into the country
in an unprecedented storm of victory? What did Italy do in the days after
her Isonzo front had collapsed? And what again did France do in the spring
of 1918 when the attack of the German divisions seemed to lift her positions
off their hinges and the far-reaching arm of the heavy long-range batteries
began to knock at the doors of Paris?How they whipped the fever heat of national passion into the
faces of the hastily retreating regiments in those countries ! What propaganda
and ingenious demagogy were used to hammer the faith in final victory back
into the hearts of the broken fronts!Meanwhile, what happened in our country?Nothing, or worse than nothing.Rage and indignation often rose up in me when I looked at the
latest newspapers, and came face to face with the psychological mass murder
that was being committed.More than once I was tormented by the thought that if Providence
had put me in the place of the incapable or criminal incompetents or scoundrels
in our propaganda service, our battle with Destiny would have taken a different
turn.In these months I felt for the first time the whole malice of
Destiny which kept me at the front in a position where every negro might
accidentally shoot me to bits, while elsewhere I would have been able to
perform quite different services for the fatherland !For even then I was rash enough to believe that I would have
succeeded in this.But I was a nameless soldier, one among eight million!And so it was better to hold my tongue and do my duty in the
trenches as best I could.In the summer of 1915, the first enemy leaflets fell into
our hands.Aside from a few changes in the form of presentation, their
Content was almost always the same, to wit: that the suffering was growing
greater and greater in Germany; that the War was going to last forever while
the hope of winning it was gradually vanishing; that the people at home
were, therefore, longing for peace, but that 'militarism' and the 'Kaiser'
did not allow it; that the whole world-to whom this was very well known-
was, therefore, not waging a war on the German people, but exclusively against
the sole guilty party, the Kaiser; that, therefore, the War would not be
over before this enemy of peaceful humanity should be eliminated; that when
the War was ended, the libertarian and democratic nations would take the
German people into the league of eternal world peace, which would be assured
from the hour when ' Prussian militarism ' was destroyed.The better to illustrate these claims, 'letters from home' were
often reprinted whose contents seemed to confirm these assertions.On the whole, we only laughed in those days at all these efforts.
The leaflets were read, then sent back to the higher staffs, and for the
most part forgotten until the wind again sent a load of them sailing down
into the trenches; for, as a rule, the leaflets were brought over by airplanes.In this type of propaganda there was one point which soon inevitably
attracted attention: in every sector of the front where Bavarians were stationed,
Prussia was attacked with extraordinary consistency, with the assurance
that not only was Prussia on the one hand the really guilty and responsible
party for the whole war, but that on the other hand there was not the slightest
hostility against Bavaria in particular; however, there was no helping Bavaria
as long as she served Prussian militarism and helped to pull its chestnuts
out of the fire.Actually this kind of propaganda began to achieve certain effects
in 1915. The feeling against Prussia grew quite visibly among the troops-yet
not a single step was taken against it from above. This was more than a
mere sin of omission, and sooner or later we were bound to suffer most catastrophically
for it; and not just the 'Prussians,' but the whole German people, to which
Bavaria herself is not the last to belong.In this direction enemy propaganda began to achieve unquestionable
successes from 1916 on.Likewise the complaining letters direct from home had long been
having their effect. It was no longer necessary for the enemy to transmit
them to the frontline soldiers by means of leaflets, etc. And against this,
aside from a few psychologically idiotic 'admonitions' on the part of the
'government,' nothing was done. Just as before, the front was flooded with
this poison dished up by thoughtless women at home, who, of course, did
not suspect that this was the way to raise the enemy's confidence in victory
to the highest pitch, thus consequently to prolong and sharpen the sufferings
of their men at the fighting front. In the time that followed, the senseless
letters of German women cost hundreds of thousands of men their lives.Thus, as early as 1916, there appeared various phenomena that
would better have been absents The men at the front complained and 'beefed';
they began to be dissatisfied in many ways and sometimes were even righteously
indignant. While they starved and suffered, while their people at home lived
in misery, there was abundance and high-living in other circles. Yes, even
at the fighting front all was not in order in this respect.Even then a slight crisis was emerging-but these were still
'internal' affairs. The same man, who at first had cursed and grumbled,
silently did his duty a few minutes later as though
this was a matter of course. The same company, which at first was discontented,
clung to the piece of trench it had to defend as though Germany's fate depended
on these few hundred yards of mudholes. It was still the front of the old,
glorious army of heroes!I was to learn the difference between it and the homeland in
a
glaring contrast.At the end of September, 1916, my division moved into the Battle
of the Somme. For us it was the first of the tremendous battles of materiel
which now followed, and the impression was hard to describe-it was more
like hell than war.Under a whirlwind of drumfire that lasted for weeks, the German
front held fast, sometimes forced back a little, then again pushing forward,
but never wavering.On October 7, 1916, I was wounded.I was brought safely to the rear, and from there was to return
to Germany with a transport.Two years had now passed since I had seen the homeland under
such conditions an almost endless time. I could scarcely imagine how Germans
looked who were not in uniform. As I lay in the field hospital at Hermies,
I almost collapsed for fright when suddenly the voice of a German woman
serving as a nurse addressed a man lying beside me.For the first time in two years to hear such a sound!The closer our train which was to bring us home approached the
border, the more inwardly restless each of us became. All the towns passed
by, through which we had ridden two years previous as young soldiers: Brussels,
Louvain, Liege, and at last we thought we recognized the first German house
by its high gable and beautiful shutters.The fatherland!In October, 1914, we had burned with stormy enthusiasm as we
crossed the border; now silence and emotion reigned. Each of us was happy
that Fate again permitted him to see what he had had to defend so hard with
his life, and each man was wellnigh ashamed to let another look him in the
eye.It was almost on the anniversary of the day when I left for
the front that I reached the hospital at Beelitz near Berlin.What a change! From the mud of the Battle of the Somme into
the white beds of this miraculous building! In the beginning we hardly dared
to lie in them properly. Only gradually could we reaccustom ourselves to
this new world.Unfortunately, this world was new in another respect as well.The spirit of the army at the front seemed no longer to be a
guest here.l Here for the first time I heard a thing that was still unknown
at the front; men bragging about their own cowardice! For the cursing and
'beefing' you could hear at the front were never an incitement to shirk
duty or a glorification of the coward. No! The coward still passed as a
coward and as nothing else; and al he contempt which struck him was still
general, just like the admiration that was given to the real hero. But here
in the hospital it was partly almost the opposite: the most unscrupulous
agitators did the talking and attempted with all the means of their contemptible
eloquence to make the conceptions of the decent soldiers ridiculous and
hold up the spineless coward as an example. A few wretched scoundrels in
particular set the tone. One boasted that he himself had pulled his hand
through a barbed-wire entanglement in order to be sent to the hospital;
in spite of this absurd wound he seemed to have been here for an endless
time, and for that matter he had only gotten into the transport to Germany
by a swindle. This poisonous fellow went so far in his insolent effrontery
as to represent his own cowardice as an emanation 2 Of higher bravery than
the hero's death of an honest soldier. Many listened in silence, others
went away, but a few assented.Disgust mounted to my throat, but the agitator was calmly tolerated
in the institution. What could be done? The management couldn't help knowing,
and actually did know, exactly who and what he was. But nothing was done.When I could again walk properly, I obtained permission to go
to Berlin.Clearly there was dire misery everywhere. The big city was suffering
from hunger. Discontent was great. In various soldiers' homes the tone was
like that in the hospital. It gave you the impression that these scoundrels
were intentionally frequenting such places in order to spread their views.But much, much worse were conditions in Munich itself !When I was discharged from the hospital as cured and transferred
to the replacement battalion, I thought I could no longer recognize the
city. Anger, discontent, cursing, wherever you went! In the replacement
battalion itself the mood was beneath all criticism. Here a contributing
factor was the immeasurably clumsy way in which the field soldiers were
treated by old training officers who hadn't spent a single hour in the field
and for this reason alone were only partially able to create a decent relationship
with the old soldiers. For it had to be admitted that the latter possessed
certain qualities which could be explained by their service at the front,
but which remained totally incomprehensible to the leaders of these replacement
detachments while the officer who had come from the front was at least able
to explain them. The latter, of course, was respected by the men quite differently
than the rear commander. But aside from this, the general mood was miserable:
to be a slacker passed almost as a sign of higher wisdom, while loyal steadfastness
was considered a symptom of inner weakness and narrow-mindedness. The offices
were filled with Jews. Nearly every clerk was a Jew and nearly every Jew
was a clerk. I was amazed at this plethora of warriors of the chosen people
and could not help but compare them with their rare representatives at the
front.As regards economic life, things were even worse Here the Jewish
people had become really 'indispensable.' The spider was slowly beginning
to suck the blood out of the people's pores. Through the war corporations,
they had found an instrument with which, little by little, to finish off
the national free economyThe necessity of an unlimited centralization was emphasizedThus, in the year 191S17 nearly the whole of production was
under the control of Jewish finance.But against whom was the hatred of the people directed?At this time I saw with horror a catastrophe approaching which,
unless averted in time, would inevitably lead to collapse.While the Jew robbed the whole nation and pressed it beneath
his domination, an agitation was carried on against the 'Prussians.' At
home, as at the front, nothing was done against this poisonous propaganda.
No one seemed to suspect that the collapse of Prussia would not by a long
shot bring with it a resurgence of Bavaria; no, that on the contrary any
fall of the one would inevitably carry the other along with it into the
abyss.I felt very badly about this behavior. In it I could only see
the craftiest trick of the Jew, calculated to distract the general attention
from himself and to others. While the Bavarian and the Prussian fought,
he stole the existence of both of them from under their nose; while the
Bavarians were cursing the Prussians, the Jew organized the revolution and
smashed Prussia and Bavaria at once.I could not bear this accursed quarrel among German peoples,
and was glad to return to the front, for which I reported at once after
my arrival in Munich.At the beginning of March, 1917, I was back with my regiment.Toward the end of I911, the low point of the army's dejection
seemed to have passed. The whole army took fresh hope and fresh courage
after the Russian collapse. The conviction that the War would end with the
victory of Germany, after all, began to seize the troops more and more.
Again singing could be heard and the Calamity Lanes became rarer. Again
people believed in the future of the fatherland.Especially the Italian collapse of autumn, 1917, had had the
most wonderful effect; in this victory we saw a proof of the possibility
of breaking through the front, even aside from the Russian theater of war.
A glorious faith flowed again into the hearts of the millions, enabling
them to await spring, 1918, with relief and confidence. The foe was visibly
depressed. In this winter he remained quieter than usual. This was the lull
before the storm.But, while those at the front were undertaking the last preparations
for the final conclusion of the eternal struggle, while endless transports
of men and materiel were rolling toward the West Front, and the troops were
being trained for the great attack- the biggest piece of chicanery in the
whole war broke out in Germany.Germany must not be victorious; in the last hour, with victory
already threatening to be with the German banners, a means was chosen which
seemed suited to stifle the German spring attack in the germ with one blow,
to make victory impossible:The munitions strike was organizedIf it succeeded, the German front was bound to collapse, and
the Vorwarts' desire that this time victory should not be with the German
banners would inevitably be fulfilled. Owing to the lack of munitions, the
front would inevitably be pierced in a few weeks; thus the offensive was
thwarted, the Entente saved international capital was made master of Germany,
and the inner aim of the Marxist swindle of nations achieved.To smash the national economy and establish the rule of international
capital a goal which actually was achieved, thanks to the stupidity and
credulity of the one side and the bottomless cowardice of the other.To be sure, the munitions strike did not have all the hoped-for
success with regard to starving the front of arms; it collapsed too soon
for the lack of munitions as such-as the plan had been- to doom the army
to destruction.But how much more terrible was the moral damage that had been
done!In the first place: What was the army fighting for if the homeland
itself no longer wanted victory? For whom the immense sacrifices and privations?
The soldier is expected to fight for victory and the homeland goes on strike
against it!And in the second place: What was the effect on the enemy?In the winter of 1917 to 1918, dark clouds appeared for the
first time in the firmament of the Allied world. For nearly four years they
had been assailing the German warrior and had been unable to encompass his
downfall; and all this while the German had only his shield arm free for
defense, while his sword was obliged to strike, now in the East, now in
the South. But now at last the giant's back was free. Streams of blood had
flown before he administered final defeat to one of his foes. Now in the
West his shield was going to be joined by his sword; up till then the enemy
had been unable to break his defense, and now he himself was facing attack.The enemy feared him and trembled for their victory.In London and Paris one deliberation followed another, but at
the front sleepy silence prevailed. Suddenly their high mightinesses lost
their effrontery. Even enemy propaganda was having a hard time of it; it
was no longer so easy to prove the hopelessness of German victory.But this also applied to the Allied troops at the fronts. A
ghastly light began to dawn slowly even on them. Their inner attitude toward
the German soldier had changed. Until then he may have seemed to them a
fool destined to defeat; but now it was the destroyer of the Russian ally
that stood before them. The limitation of the German offensives to the East,
though born of necessity, now seemed to them brilliant tactics. For three
years these Germans had stormed the Russian front, at first it seemed without
the slightest success. The Allies almost laughed over this aimless undertaking;
for in the end the Russian giant with his overwhelming number of men was
sure to remain the victor while Germany would inevitably collapse from loss
of blood. Reality seemed to confirm this hope.Since the September days of 1914, when for the first time the
endless hordes of Russian prisoners from the Battle of Tannenberg began
moving into Germany over the roads and railways, this stream was almost
without end-but for every defeated and destroyed army a new one arose. Inexhaustibly
the gigantic Empire gave the Tsar more and more new soldiers and the War
its new victims. How long could Germany keep up this race? Would not the
day inevitably come when the Germans would win their last victory and still
the Russian armies would not be marching to their last battle? And then
what? In all human probability the victory of Russia could be postponed,
but it was bound to come.Now all these hopes were at an end: the ally who had laid the
greatest blood sacrifices on the altar of common interests was at the end
of his strength, and lay prone at the feet of the inexorable assailant.
Fear and horror crept into the hearts of the soldiers who had hitherto believed
so blindly. They feared the coming spring. For if up until then they had
not succeeded in defeating the German when he was able to place only part
of his forces on the Western Front, how could they count on victory now
that the entire power of this incredible heroic state seemed to be concentrating
for an attack on the West?The shadows of the South Tyrolean Mountains lay oppressive on
the fantasy; as far as the mists of Flanders, the defeated armies of Cadorna
conjured up gloomy faces, and faith in victory ceded to fear of coming defeat.Then-when out of the cool nights the Allied soldiers already
seemed to hear the dull rumble of the advancing storm units of the German
army, and with eyes fixed in fear and trepidation awaited the approaching
judgment, suddenly a flaming red light arose in Germany, casting its glow
into the last shell-hole of the enemy front: at the very moment when the
German divisions were receiving their last instructions for the great attack,
the general strike broke out in Germany.At first the world was speechless. But then enemy propaganda
hurled itself with a sigh of relief on this help that came in the eleventh
hour. At one stroke the means was found to restore the sinking confidence
of the Allied soldiers, once again to represent the probability of victory
as certain,l and transform dread anxiety in the face of coming events into
determined confidence. Now the regiments awaiting the German attack could
be sent into the greatest battle of all time with the conviction that, not
the boldness of the German assault would decide the end of this war but
the perseverance of the defense. Let the Germans achieve as many victories
as they pleased; at home the revolution was before the door, and not the
victorious army..English, French, and American newspapers began to implant this
faith in the hearts of their readers while an infinitely shrewd propaganda
raised the spirits of the troops at the front.'Germany facing revolution! Victory of the Allies inevitable!
This was the best medicine to help the wavering poilu and Tommy back on
their feet. Now rifles and machine guns could again be made to fire, and
a headlong flight in panic fear was replaced by hopeful resistance.This was the result of the munitions strike. It strengthened
the enemy peoples' belief in victory and relieved the paralyzing despair
of the Allied front-in the time that followed, thousands of German soldiers
had to pay for this with their blood. The instigators of this vilest of
all scoundrelly tricks were the aspirants to the highest state positions
of revolutionary Germany.On the German side, it is true, the visible reaction to this
crime could at first apparently be handled; on the enemy side, however,
the consequences did not fail to appear. The resistance had lost the aimlessness
of an army giving up all as lost, and took on the bitterness of a struggle
for victory.For now, in all human probability, victory was inevitable if
the Western Front could stand up under a German attack for only a few months.
The parliaments of the Entente, however, recognized the possibilities for
the future and approved unprecedented expenditures for continuing the propaganda
to disrupt Germany.I had the good fortune to fight in the first two offensives
and in the last.These became the most tremendous impressions of my life; tremendous
because now for the last time, as in 1914, the fight lost the character
of defense and assumed that of attack. A sigh of relief passed through the
trenches and the dugouts of the German army when at length, after more than
three years' endurance in the enemy hell, the day of retribution came. Once
again the victorious battalions cheered and hung the last wreaths of immortal
laurel on their banners rent by the storm of victory. Once again the songs
of the fatherland roared to the heavens along the endless marching columns,
and for the last time the Lord's grace smiled on His ungrateful children.In midsummer of 1918, oppressive sultriness lay over the
front. At home there was fighting. For what? In the different detachments
of the field army all sorts of things were being said: that the war was
now hopeless and only fools could believe in victory That not the people
but only capital and the monarchy had an interest in holding out any longer-all
this came from the homeland and was discussed even at the front.At first the front reacted very little. What did we care about
universal suffrage? Had we fought four years for that? It was vile banditry
to steal the war aim of the dead heroes from their very graves. The young
regiments had not gone to their death in Flanders crying: 'Long dive universal
suffrage and the secret ballot,' but crying: 'Deutschland uber Alles in
der Welt.' A small yet not entirely insignificant, difference. But most
of those who cried out for suffrage hadn't ever been in the place where
they now wanted to fight for it. The front was unknown to the whole political
party rabble. Only a small fraction of the Parliamentary ian gentlemen could
be seen where all decent Germans with sound limbs left were sojourning at
that time.And so the old personnel at the front was not very receptive
to this new war aims of Messrs. Ebert, Scheidemann, Barth, Liebnitz, etc.
They couldn't for the life of them see why suddenly the slackers should
have the right to arrogate to themselves control of the state over the heads
of the army.My personal attitude was established from the very start. I
hated the whole gang of miserable party scoundrels and betrayers of the
people in the extreme. It had long been clear to me that this whole gang
was not really concerned with the welfare of the nation, but with filling
empty pockets. For this they were ready to sacrifice the whole nation, and
if necessary to let Germany be destroyed; and in my eyes this made them
ripe for hanging. To take consideration of their wishes was to sacrifice
the interests of the working people for the benefit of a few pickpockets;
these wishes could only be fulfilled by giving up Germany.And the great majority of the embattled army still thought the
same. Only the reinforcements coming from home rapidly grew worse and worse,
so that their arrival meant, not a reinforcement but a weakening of our
fighting strength. Especially the young reinforcements were mostly worthless.
It was often hard to believe that these were sons of the same nation which
had once sent its youth out to the battle for Ypres.In August and September, the symptoms of disorganization increased
more and more rapidly, although the effect of the enemy attack was not to
be compared with the terror of our former defensive battles. The past Battle
of Flanders and the Battle of the Somme had been awesome by comparison.At the end of September, my division arrived for the third time
at the positions which as young volunteer regiments we had once stormed.What a memory!In October and November of I914, we had there received our baptism
of fire. Fatherland love in our heart and songs on our lips, our young regiments
had gone into the battle as to a dance The most precious blood there sacrificed
itself joyfully, in the faith that it was preserving the independence and
freedom of the fatherland.In July, I917, we set foot for the second time on the ground
that was sacred to all of us. For in it the best comrades slumbered still
almost children, who had run to their death with gleaming eyes for the one
true fatherland.We old soldiers, who had then marched out with the regiment
stood in respectful emotion at this shrine of 'loyalty and obedience to
the death.'Now in a hard defensive battle the regiment was to defend this
soil which it had stormed three years earlier.With three weeks of drumfire the Englishman prepared the great
Flanders offensive. The spirits of the dead seemed to quicken; the regiment
clawed its way into the filthy mud, bit into the various holes and craters,
and neither gave ground nor wavered. As once before in this place, it grew
steadily smaller and thinner, until the British attack finally broke loose
on July 13, 1917.In the first days of August we were relieved.The regiment had turned into a few companies: crusted with mud
they tottered back, more like ghosts than men. But aside from a few hundred
meters of shell holes, the Englishman had found nothing but death.Now, in the fall of 1918, we stood for the third time on the
storm site of 1914. The little city of Comines where we then rested had
now become our battlefield. Yet, though the battlefield was the same, the
men had changed: for now 'political discussions went on even among the troops.
As everywhere, the poison of the hinterland began, here too, to be effective.
And the younger recruit fell down completely for he came from home.In the night of October 13, the English gas attack on the southern
front before Ypres burst loose; they used yellow-cross gas, whose effects
were still unknown to us as far as personal experience was concerned. In
this same night I myself was to become acquainted with it. On a hill south
of Wervick, we came on the evening of October 13 into several hours of drumfire
with gas shells which continued all night more or less violently. As early
as midnight, a number of us passed out, a few of our comrades forever. Toward
morning I, too, was seized with pain which grew worse with every quarter
hour, and at seven in the morning I stumbled and tottered back with burning
eyes; taking with me my last report of the War.A few hours later, my eyes had turned into glowing coals; it
had grown dark around me.Thus I came to the hospital at Pasewalk in Pomerania, and there
I was fated to experience-the greatest villainy of the century.For a long time there had been something indefinite but repulsive
in the air. People were telling each other that in the next few weeks it
would ' start in '-but I was unable to imagine what was meant by this. First
I thought of a strike like that of the spring. Unfavorable rumors were constantly
coming from the navy, which was said to be in a state of ferment. But this,
too, seemed to me more the product of the imagination of individual scoundrels
than an affair involving real masses. Even in the hospital, people were
discussing the end of the War which they hoped would come soon, but no one
counted on anything immediate. I was unable to read the papers.In November the general tension increased.And then one day, suddenly and unexpectedly, the calamity descended.
Sailors arrived in trucks and proclaimed the revolution; a few Jewish youths
were the 'leaders' in this struggle for the 'freedom, beauty, and dignity'
of our national existence. None of them had been at the front. By way of
a so-called 'gonorrhoea hospital,' the three Orientals had been sent back
home from their second-line base. Now they raised the red rag in the homeland.In the last few days I had been getting along better. The piercing
pain in my eye sockets was diminishing; slowly I succeeded in distinguishing
the broad outlines of the things about me. I was given grounds for hoping
that I should recover my eyesight at least well enough to be able to pursue
some profession later. To be sure, I could no longer hope that I would ever
be able to draw again. In any case, I was on the road to improvement when
the monstrous thing happened.My first hope was still that this high treason might still be
a more or less local affair. I also tried to bolster up a few comrades in
this view. Particularly my Bavarian friends in the hospital were more than
accessible to this. The mood there was anything but 'revolutionary.' I could
not imagine that the madness would break out in Munich, too. Loyalty to
the venerable House of Wittelsbach seemed to me stronger, after all, than
the will of a few Jews. Thus I could not help but believe that this was
merely a Putsch on the part of the navy and would be crushed in the next
few days.The next few days came and with them the most terrible certainty
of my life. The rumors became more and more oppressive. What I had taken
for a local affair was now said to be a general revolution. To this was
added the disgraceful news from the front. They wanted to capitulate. Was
such a thing really possible?On November 10, the pastor came to the hospital for a short
address: now we learned everything.In extreme agitation, I, too, was present at the short speech.
The dignified old gentleman seemed all a-tremble as he informed us that
the House of Hollenzollern should no longer bear the German imperial crown;
that the fatherland had become a ' republic '; that we must pray to the
Almighty not to refuse His blessing to this change and not to abandon our
people in the times to come. He could not help himself, he had to speak
a few words in memory of the royal house. He began to praise its services
in Pomerania, in Prussia, nay, to the German fatherland, and-here he began
to sob gently to himself-in the little hall the deepest dejection settled
on all hearts, and I believe that not an eye was able to restrain its tears.
But when the old gentleman tried to go on, and began to tell us that we
must now end the long War, yes, that now that it was lost and we were throwing
ourselves upon the mercy of the victors, our fatherland would for the future
be exposed to dire oppression, that the armistice should be accepted with
confidence in the magnanimity of our previous enemies-I could stand it no
longer. It became impossible for me to sit still one minute more. Again
everything went black before my eyes; I tottered and groped my way back
to the dormitory, threw myself on my bunk, and dug my burning head into
my blanket and pillow.Since the day when I had stood at my mother's grave, I had not
wept. When in my youth Fate seized me with merciless hardness, my defiance
mounted. When in the long war years Death snatched so many a dear comrade
and friend from our ranks, it would have seemed to me almost a sin to complain-
after all, were they not dying for Germany? And when at length the creeping
gas-in the last days of the dreadful struggle- attacked me, too, and began
to gnaw at my eyes, and beneath the fear of going blind forever, I nearly
lost heart for a moment, the voice of my conscience thundered at me: Miserable
wretch, are you going to cry when thousands are a hundred times worse off
than you! And so I bore my lot in dull silence. But now I could not help
it. Only now did I see how all personal suffering vanishes in comparison
with the misfortune of the fatherland.And so it had all been in vain. In vain all the sacrifices and
privations; in vain the hunger and thirst of months which were often endless;
in vain the hours in which, with mortal fear clutching at our hearts, we
nevertheless did our duty; and in vain the death of two millions who died.
Would not the graves of all the hundreds of thousands open, the graves of
those who with faith in the fatherland had marched forth never to return?
Would they not open and send the silent mud- and blood-covered heroes back
as spirits of vengeance to the homeland which had cheated them with such
mockery of the highest sacrifice which a man can make to his people in this
world? Had they died for is, the soldiers of August and September, 1914?
Was it for this that in the autumn of the same year the volunteer regiments
marched after their old comrades? Was it for this that these boys of seventeen
sank into the earth of Flanders? Was this the meaning of the sacrifice which
the German mother made to the fatherland when with sore heart she let her
best-loved boys march off, never to see them again? Did all this happen
only so that a gang of wretched criminals could lay hands on the fatherland?Was it for this that the German soldier had stood host in the
sun's heat-and in snowstorms, hungry, thirsty, and freezing, weary from
sleepless nights and endless marches? Was it for this that he had lain in
the hell of the drumfire and in the fever of gas attacks without wavering,
always thoughtful of his one duty to preserve the fatherland from the enemy
peril?Verily these heroes deserved a headstone: 'Thou Wanderer who
comest to Germany, tell those at home that we lie here, true to the fatherland
and obedient to duty.'And what about those at home-?And yet, was it only our own sacrifice that we had to weigh
in the balance? Was the Germany of the past less precious? Was there no
obligation toward our own history? Were we still worthy to relate the glory
of the past to ourselves? And how could this deed be justified to future
generations?Miserable and degenerate criminals!The more I tried to achieve clarity on the monstrous event in
this hour, the more the shame of indignation and disgrace burned my brow.
What was all the pain in my eyes compared to this misery?There followed terrible days and even worse nights-I knew that
all was lost. Only fools, liars, and criminals could hope in the mercy of
the enemy. In these nights hatred grew in me, hatred for those responsible
for this deed.In the days that followed, my own fate became known to me.I could not help but laugh at the thought of my own future which
only a short time before had given me such bitter concern. Was it not ridiculous
to expect to build houses on such ground? At last it became clear to me
that what had happened was what I had so often feared but had never been
able to believe with my emotions.Kaiser William II was the first German Emperor to hold out a
conciliatory hand to the leaders of Marxism, without suspecting that scoundrels
have no honor. While they still held the imperial hand in theirs, their
other hand was reaching for the dagger.There is no making pacts with Jews; there can only be the hard:
either-or.I, for my part, decided to go into politics.


AT THE END of November, 1918, I returned to Munich. Again I
went to the replacement battalion of my regiment, which was in the hands
of 'soldiers' councils.' Their whole activity was so repellent to me that
I decided at once to leave again as soon as possible. With Schmiedt Ernst,
a faithful war comrade, I went to Traunstein and remained there till the
camp was broken up.In March, 1919, we went back to Munich.The situation was untenable and moved inevitably toward a further
continuation of the revolution. Eisner's death only hastened the development
and finally led to a dictatorship of the Councils, or, better expressed,
to a passing rule of the Jews, as had been the original aim of the instigators
of the whole revolution.At this time endless plans chased one another through my head.
For days I wondered what could be done, but the end of every meditation
was the sober realization that I, nameless as I was, did not possess the
least basis for any useful action. I shall come back to speak of the reasons
why then, as before, I could not decide to join any of the existing parties.
In the course of the new revolution of the Councils I for the first time
acted in such a way as to arouse the disapproval of the Central Council.
Early in the morning of April 27, 1919, I was to be arrested, but, faced
with my leveled carbine, the three scoundrels lacked the necessary courage
and marched off as they had come.A few days after the liberation of Munich, I was ordered to
report to the examining commission concerned with revolutionary occurrences
in the Second Infantry Regiment.This was my first more or less purely political activity.Only a few weeks afterward I received orders to attend a ' course
' that was held for members of the armed forces. In it the soldier was supposed
to learn certain fundamentals of civic thinking. For me the value of the
whole affair was that I now obtained an opportunity of fleeting a few like-minded
comrades with whom I could thoroughly discuss the situation of the moment.
All of us were more or less firmly convinced that Germany could no longer
be saved from the impending collapse by the parties of the November crime,
the Center and the Social Democracy, and that the so-called 'bourgeois-national'
formations, even with the best of intentions, could never repair what had
happened. A whole series of preconditions were lacking, without which such
a task simply could not succeed. The following period confirmed the opinion
we then held. Thus, in our own circle we discussed the foundation of a new
party. The basic ideas which we had in mind were the same as those later
realized in the ' German Workers' Party.' The name of the movement to be
founded would from the very beginning have to offer the possibility of approaching
the broad masses; for without this quality the whole task seemed aimless
and superfluous. Thus we arrived at the name of ' Social Revolutionary Party';
this because the social views of the new organization did indeed mean a
revolution.But the deeper ground for this lay in the following: however
much I had concerned myself with economic questions at an earlier day, my
efforts had remained more or less within the limits resulting from the contemplation
of social questions as such. Only later did this framework broaden through
examination of the German alliance policy. This in very great part was the
outcome of a false estimation of economics as well as unclarity concerning
the possible basis for sustaining the German people in the future. But all
these ideas were based on the opinion that capital in any case was solely
the result of labor and, therefore, like itself was subject to the correction
of all those factors which can either advance or thwart human activity;
and the national importance of capital was that it depended so completely
on the greatness, freedom, and power of the state, hence of the nation,
that this bond in itself would inevitably cause capital to further the state
and the nation owing to its simple instinct of self-preservation or of reproduction.
This dependence of capital on the independent free state would, therefore,
force capital in turn to champion this freedom, power, strength, etc., of
the nation.Thus, the task of the state toward capital was comparatively
simple and clear: it only had to make certain that capital remain the handmaiden
of the state and not fancy itself the mistress of the nation. This point
of view could then be defined between two restrictive limits: preservation
of a solvent, national, and independent economy on the one hand, assurance
of the social rights of the workers on the other.Previously I had been unable to recognize with the desired clarity
the difference between this pure capital as the end result of productive
labor and a capital whose existence and essence rests exclusively on speculation.
For this I lacked the initial inspiration, which had simply not come my
way.
But now this was provided most amply by one of the various gentlemen lecturing
in the above-mentioned course: Gottfried Feder.For the first time in my life I heard a principled discussion
of international stock exchange and loan capital.Right after listening to Feder's first lecture, the thought
ran through my head that I had now found the way to one of the most essential
premises for the foundation of a new party.In my eyes Feder's merit consisted in having established
with ruthless brutality the speculative and economic character of stock
exchange and loan capital, and in having exposed its eternal and age-old
presupposition which is interest. His arguments were so sound in all fundamental
questions that their critics from the start questioned the theoretical correctness
of the idea less than they doubted the practical possibility of its execution.
But what in the eyes of others was a weakness of Feder's arguments, in my
eyes constituted their strength.It is not the task of a theoretician to determine the varying
degrees in which a cause can be realized, but to establish the cause as
such: that is to say: he must concern himself less with the road than with
the goal. In this, however, the basic correctness of an idea is decisive
and not the difficulty of its execution. As soon as the theoretician attempts
to take account of so-called 'utility' and 'reality' instead of the absolute
truth, his work will cease to be a polar star of seeking humanity and instead
will become a prescription for everyday life. The theoretician of a movement
must lay down its goal, the politician strive for its fulfillment. The thinking
of the one, therefore, will be determined by eternal truth, the actions
of the other more by the practical reality of the moment. The greatness
of the one lies in the absolute abstract soundness of his idea, that of
the other in his correct attitude toward the given facts and their advantageous
application; and in this the theoretician's aim must serve as his guiding
star. While the touchstone for the stature of a politician may be regarded
as the success of his plans and acts-in other words, the degree to which
they become reality-the realization of the theoretician's ultimate purpose
can never be realized, since, though human thought can apprehend truths
and set up crystal-clear aims, complete fulfillment will fail due to the
general imperfection and inadequacy of man. The more abstractly correct
and hence powerful the idea will be, the more impossible remains its complete
fulfillment as long as it continues to depend on human beings. Therefore,
the stature of the theoretician must not be measured by the fulfillment
of his aims, but by their soundness and the influence they have had on the
development of humanity. If this were not so, the founders of religion could
not be counted among the greatest men of this earth, since the fulfillment
of their ethical purposes will never be even approximately complete. In
its workings, even the religion of love is only the weak reflection of the
will of its exalted founder; its significance, however, lies in the direction
which it attempted to give to a universal human development of culture,
ethics, and morality.The enormous difference between the tasks of the theoretician
and the politician is also the reason why a union of both in one person
is almost never found. This is especially true of the so-called 'successful'
politician of small format, whose activity for the most part is only an
'art of the possible,' as Bismarck rather modestly characterized politics
in general. The freer such a 'politician' keeps himself from great ideas,
the easier and often the more visible, but always the more rapid, his successes
will be. To be sure, they are dedicated to earthly transitoriness and sometimes
do not survive the death of their fathers. The work of such politicians,
by and large, is unimportant nor posterity, since their successes in the
present are based solely on keeping at a distance all really great and profound
problems and ideas, which as such would only have been of value for later
generations.The execution of such aims, which have value and significance
for the most distant times, usually brings little reward to the man who
champions them and rarely finds understanding among the great masses, who
for the moment have more understanding for beer and milk regulations than
for farsighted plans for the future, whose realization can only occur far
hence, and whose benefits will be reaped only by posterity.Thus, from a certain vanity, which is always a cousin of stupidity,
the great mass of politicians will keep far removed from all really weighty
plans for the future, in order not to lose the momentary sympathy of the
great mob. The success and significance of such a politician lie then exclusively
in the present, and do not exist for posterity. But small minds are little
troubled by this; they are content.With the theoretician conditions are different. His importance
lies almost always solely in the future, for not seldom he is what is described
by the world as 'unworldly.' For if the art of the politician is really
the art of the possible, the theoretician is one of those of whom it can
be said that they are pleasing to the gods only if they demand and want
the impossible. He will almost always have to renounce the recognition of
the present, but in return, provided his ideas are immortal, will harvest
the fame of posterity.In long periods of humanity, it may happen once that the politician
is wedded to the theoretician. The more profound this fusion, however, the
greater are the obstacles opposing the work of the politician. He no longer
works for necessities which will be understood by the first best shopkeeper,
but for aims which only the fewest comprehend. Therefore, his life is torn
by love and hate. The protest of the present which does not understand the
man, struggles with the recognition of posterity-for which he works.
For the greater a man's works for the future, the less the present can comprehend
them; the harder his fight, and the rarer success. If, however, once in
centuries success does come to a man, perhaps in his latter days a faint
beam of his coming glory may shine upon him. To be sure, these great men
are only the Marathon runners of history; the laurel wreath of the present
touches only the brow of the dying hero.Among them must be counted the great warriors in this world
who, though not understood by the present, are nevertheless prepared to
carry the fight for their ideas and ideals to their end. They are the men
who some day will be closest to the heart of the people; it almost seems
as though every individual feels the duty of compensating in the past for
the sins which the present once committed against the great. Their life
and work are followed with admiring gratitude and emotion, and especially
in days of gloom they have the power to raise up broken hearts and despairing
souls.To them belong, not only the truly great statesmen, but all
other great reformers as well. Beside Frederick the Great stands Martin
Luther as well as Richard Wagner.As I listened to Gottfried Feder's first lecture about the 'breaking
of interest slavery,' I knew at once that this was a theoretical truth which
would inevitably be of immense importance for the future of the German people.
The sharp separation of stock exchange capital from the national economy
offered the possibility of opposing the internationalization of the German
economy without at the same time menacing the foundations of an independent
national self-maintenance by a struggle against all capital. The development
of Germany was much too clear in my eyes for me not to know that the hardest
battle would have to be fought, not against hostile nations, but against
international capital. In Feder's lecture I sensed a powerful slogan for
this coming struggle.And here again later developments proved how correct our sentiment
of those days was. Today the know-it-alls among our
bourgeois politicians no longer laugh at us: today even they, in so far
as they are not conscious liars, see that international stock exchange capital
was not only the greatest agitator for the War, but that especially, now
that the fight is over, it spares no effort to turn the peace into a hell.The fight against international finance and loan capital became
the most important point in the program of the German nation's struggle
for its economic independence and freedom.As regards the objections of so-called practical men, they can
be answered as follows: All fears regarding the terrible economic consequences
of the ' breaking of interest slavery ' are superfluous; for, in the first
place, the previous economic prescriptions have turned out very badly for
the German people, and your positions on the problems of national self-maintenance
remind us strongly of the reports of similar experts in former times, for
example, those of the Bavarian medical board on the question of introducing
the railroad. It is well known that none of the fears of this exalted corporation
were later realized: the travelers in the trains of the new 'steam horse
' did not get dizzy, the onlookers did not get sick, and the board fences
to hide the new invention from sight were given up-only the board fences
around the brains of all so-called 'experts' were preserved for posterity.In the second place, the following should be noted: every idea,
even the best, becomes a danger if it parades as a purpose in itself, being
in reality only a means to one. For me and all true National Socialists
there is but one doctrine: people and fatherland.What we must fight for is to safeguard the existence and reproduction
of our race and our people, the sustenance of our children and the purity
of our blood, the freedom and independence of the fatherland, so that our
people may mature for the fulfillment of the mission allotted it by the
creator of the universe.Every thought and every idea, every doctrine and all knowledge,
must serve this purpose. And everything must be examined from this point
of view and used or rejected according to its utility. Then no theory will
stiffen into a dead doctrine, since it is life alone that all things must
serve.Thus, it was the conclusions of Gottfried Feder that caused
me to delve into the fundamentals of this field with which I had previously
not been very familiar.I began to study again, and now for the first time really achieved
an understanding of the content of the Jew Karl Marx's life effort. Only
now did his Capital become really intelligible to me, and also the struggle
of the Social Democracy against the national economy, which aims only to
prepare the ground for the domination of truly international finance and
stock exchange capital.But also in another respect these courses were of the greatest
consequence to me.One day I asked for the floor. One of the participants felt
obliged to break a lance for the Jews and began to defend them in lengthy
arguments. This aroused me to an answer. The overwhelming majority of the
students present took my standpoint The result was that a few days later
I was sent into a Munich regiment as a so-called 'educational officer.'Discipline among the men was still comparatively weak at that
time. It suffered from the after-effects of the period of soldiers' councils.
Only very slowly and cautiously was it possible to replace voluntary obedience-the
pretty name that was given to the pig-sty under Kurt Eisner-by the old military
discipline and subordination. Accordingly, the men were now expected to
learn to feel and think in a national and patriotic way. In these two directions
lay the field of my new activity.I started out with the greatest enthusiasm and love. For all
at once I was offered an opportunity of speaking before a larger audience;
and the thing that I had always presumed from pure feeling without knowing
it was now corroborated: I could 'speak.' My voice, too, had grown so much
better that I could be sufficiently understood at least in every corner
of the small squad rooms.No task could make me happier than this, for now before being
discharged I was able to perform useful services to the institution which
had been so close to my heart: the army.And I could boast of some success: in the course of my lectures
I led many hundreds, indeed thousands, of comrades back to their people
and fatherland. I 'nationalized' the troops and was thus also able to help
strengthen the general discipline.Here again I became acquainted with a number of like-minded
comrades, who later began to form the nucleus of the new movement.


ONE DAY I received orders from my headquarters to find out what was behind
an apparently political organization which was planning to hold a meeting
within th next few days under the name of 'German Workers' Party'-with Gottfried
Feder as one of the speakers. I was told to go and take a look at the organization
and then make a report.The curiosity of the army toward political parties in those
days was more than understandable. The revolution had given the soldiers
the right of political activity, and it was just the most inexperienced
among them who made the most ample use of it. Not until the moment when
the Center and the Social Democracy were forced to recognize, to their own
grief, that the sympathies of the soldiers were beginning to turn away from
the revolutionary parties toward the national movement and reawakening,
did they see fit to deprive the troops of suffrage again and prohibit their
political activity.It was illuminating that the Center and the Marxists should
have taken this measure, for if they had not undertaken this curtailment
of ' civil rights '-as the political equality of the soldiers after the
revolution was called-within a few years there would have been no revolution,
and hence no more national dishonor and disgrace. The troops were then well
on their way toward ridding the nation of its leeches and the stooges of
the Entente within our walls. The fact that the so-called 'national' parties
voted enthusiastically for the correction of the previous views of the November
criminals, and thus helped to blunt the instrument of a national rising,
again showed what the eternally doctrinaire ideas of these innocents among
innocents can lead to. This bourgeoisie was really suffering from mental
senility; in all seriousness they harbored the opinion that the army would
again become what it had been, to wit, a stronghold of German military power;
while the Center and Marxism planned only to tear out its dangerous national
poison fang, without which, however, an army remains forever a police force,
but is not a troop capable of fighting an enemy-as has been amply proved
in the time that followed.Or did our 'national politicians' believe that the development
of the army could have been other than national? That would have been confoundedly
like the gentlemen and is what comes of not being a soldier in war but a
big-mouth; in other words, a parliamentarian with no notion of what goes
on in the hearts of men who are reminded by the most colossal past that
they were once the best soldiers in the world.And so I decided to attend the above-mentioned meeting of this
party which up till then had been entirely unknown to me too.In the evening when I entered the 'Leiber Room' of the former
Sterneckerbrau in Munich, I found some twenty to twenty-five people present,
chiefly from the lower classes of the population.
Feder's lecture was known to me from the courses, so I was able to devote
myself to an inspection of the organization itself.
My impression was neither good nor bad; a new organization like so many
others. This was a time in which anyone who was not satisfied with developments
and no longer had any confidence in the existing parties felt called upon
to found a new party. Everywhere these organizations sprang out of the ground,
only to vanish silently after a time. The founders for the most part had
no idea what it means to make a party-let alone a movement out of a club.
And so these organizations nearly always stifle automatically in their absurd
philistinism.I judged the 'German Workers' Party' no differently. When Feder
finally stopped talking, I was happy. I had seen enough and wanted to leave
when the free discussion period, which was now announced, moved me to remain,
after all. But here, too everything seemed to run along insignificantly
until suddenly a 'professor' took the floor; he first questioned the soundness
of Feder's arguments and then-after Feder replied very well- suddenly appealed
to 'the facts,' but not without recommending most urgently that the young
party take up the 'separation' of Bavaria from 'Prussia' as a particularly
important programmatic point. With bold effrontery the man maintained that
in this case German-Austria would at once join Bavaria, that the peace would
then become much better, and more similar nonsense. At this point I could
not help demanding the floor and giving the learned gentleman my opinion
on this point-with the result that the previous speaker, even before I was
finished, left the hall like a wet poodle. As I spoke, the audience had
listened with astonished faces, and only as I was beginning to say good
night to the assemblage and go away did a man come leaping after me, introduce
himself (I had not quite understood his name), and press a little booklet
into my hand, apparently a political pamphlet, with the urgent request that
I read it.This was very agreeable to me, for now I had reason to hope
that I might become acquainted with this dull organization in a simpler
way, without having to attend any more such interesting meetings. Incidentally
this apparent worker had made a good impression on me. And with this I left
the hall.At that time I was still living in the barracks of the Second
Infantry Regiment in a little room that still very distinctly bore the traces
of the revolution. During the day I was out, mostly with the Forty-First
Rifle Regiment, or at meetings, or lectures in some other army unit, etc.
Only at night did I sleep in my quarters. Since I regularly woke up before
five o'clock in the morning, I had gotten in the habit of putting a few
left-overs or crusts of bread on the floor for the mice which amused themselves
in my little room, and watching the droll little beasts chasing around after
these choice morsels. I had known so much poverty in my life that I was
well able to imagine the hunger, and hence also the pleasure, of the little
creatures.At about five o'clock in the morning after this meeting, I thus
lay awake in my cot, watching the chase and bustle. Since I could no longer
fall asleep, I suddenly remembered the past evening and my mind fell on
the booklet which the worker had given me. I began to read. It was a little
pamphlet in which the author, this same worker, described how he had returned
to national thinking out of the Babel of Marxist and trade-unionist phrases;
hence also the title: My Political Awakening.l Once I had begun, I read
the little book through with interest; for it reflected a process similar
to the one which I myself had gone through twelve years before. Involuntarily
I saw my own development come to life before my eyes. In the course of the
day I reflected a few times on the matter and was finally about to put it
aside when, less than a week later, much to my surprise, I received a postcard
saying that I had been accepted in the German Workers' Party; I was requested
to express myself on the subject and for this purpose to attend a committee
meeting of this party on the following Wednesday.I must admit that I was astonished at this way of 'winning'
members and I didn't know whether to be angry or to laugh. I had no intention
of joining a ready-made party, but wanted to found one of my own. What they
asked of me was presumptuous and out of the question.I was about to send the gentlemen my answer in writing when
curiosity won out and I decided to appear on the appointed day to explain
my reasons by word of mouth.Wednesday came. The tavern in which the said meeting was to
take place was the 'Aites Rosenbad' in the Herrenstrasse, a very run-down
place that no one seemed to stray into more than once in a blue moon. No
wonder, in the year 1919 when the menu of even the larger restaurants could
offer only the scantiest and most modest allurements. Up to this time this
tavern had been totally unknown to me.I went through the ill-lit dining room in which not a soul was
sitting, opened the door to the back room, and the 'session' was before
me. In the dim light of a broken-down gas lamp four young people sat at
a table, among them the author of the little pamphlet, who at once greeted
me most joyfully and bade me welcome as a new member of the German Workers'
PartyReally, I was somewhat taken aback. As I was now informed that
the actual 'national chairman' had not yet arrived, I decided to wait with
my declaration. This gentleman finally appeared. It was the same who had
presided at the meeting in the Sterneckerbrau on the occasion of Feder's
lectureMeanwhile, I had again become very curious, and waited expectantly
for what was to come. Now at least I came to know the names of the individual
gentlemen. The chairman of the 'national organization' was a Herr Harrer,
that of the Munich District, Anton Drexler.The minutes of the last meeting were read and the secretary
was given a vote of confidence. Next came the treasury report- all in all
the association possessed seven marks and fifty pfennigs &shyp; for which
the treasurer received a vote of general confidence. This, too, was entered
in the minutes. Then the first chairman read the answers to a letter from
Kiel, one from Dusseldorf, and one from Berlin, and everyone expressed approval.
Next a report was given on the incoming mail: a letter from Berlin, one
from Dusseldorf and one from Kiel, whose arrival seemed to be received with
great satisfaction. This growing correspondence was interpreted as the best
and most visible sign of the spreading importance of the German Workers'
Party, and then-then there was a long deliberation with regard to the answers
to be made.Terrible, terrible! This was club life of the worst manner and
sort. Was I to join this organization?Next, new memberships were discussed; in other words, my capture
was taken up.I now began to ask questions-but, aside from a few directives,
there was nothing, no program, no leaflet, no printed matter at all, no
membership cards, not even a miserable rubber stamp, only obvious good faith
and good intentions.I had stopped smiling, for what was this if not a typical sign
of the complete helplessness and total despair of all existing parties,
their programs, their purposes, and their activity? The thing that drove
these few young people to activity that was outwardly so absurd was only
the emanation of their inner voice, which more instinctively than consciously
showed them that all parties up till then were suited neither for raising
up the German nation nor for curing its inner wounds. I quickly read the
typed 'directives' and in them I saw more seeking than knowledge. Much was
vague or unclear, much was missing, but nothing was present which could
not have passed as a sign of a struggling realization.I knew what these men felt: it was the longing for a new movement
which should be more than a party in the previous sense of the wold.That evening when I returned to the barracks I had formed my
judgment of this association.I was facing the hardest question of my life: should I join
or should I decline?Reason could advise me only to decline, but my feeling left
me no rest, and as often as I tried to remember the absurdity of this whole
club, my feeling argued for it.I was restless in the days that followed.I began to ponder back and forth. I had long been resolved to
engage in political activity; that this could be done only in a new movement
was likewise clear to me, only the impetus to act had hitherto been lacking.
I am not one of those people who begin something today and lay it down tomorrow,
if possible taking up something else again. This very conviction among others
was the main reason why it was so hard for me to make up my mind to join
such a new organization. I knew that for me a decision would be for good,
with no turning back. For me it was no passing game but grim earnest. Even
then I had an instinctive revulsion toward men who start everything and
never carry anything out These jacks-of-all-trades were loathsome to me.
I regarded the activity of such people as worse than doing nothing.And this way of thinking constituted one of the main reasons
why I could not make up my mind as easily as some others do to found a cause
which either had to become everything or else would do better not to exist
at all.Fate itself now seemed to give me a hint. I should never have
gone into one of the existing large parties, and later on I shall go into
the reasons for this more closely. This absurd little organization with
its few members seemed to me to possess the one advantage that it had not
frozen into an 'organization,' but left the individual an opportunity for
real personal activity. Here it was still possible to work, and the smaller
the movement, the more readily it could be put into the proper form. Here
the content, the goal, and the road could still be determined, which in
the existing great parties was impossible from the outset.The longer I tried to think it over, the more the conviction
grew in me that through just such a little movement the rise of the nation
could some day be organized, but never through the political parliamentary
parties which clung far too greatly to the old conceptions or even shared
in the profits of the new regime. For it was a new philosophy and not a
new election slogan that had to be proclaimed.Truly a very grave decision-to begin transforming this intention
into reality!What prerequisites did I myself bring to this task?That I was poor and without means seemed to me the most bearable
part of it, but it was harder that I was numbered among the nameless, that
I was one of the millions whom chance permits to live or summons out of
existence without even their closest neighbors condescending to take any
notice of it. In addition, there was the difficulty which inevitably arose
from my lack of schooling.The so called 'intelligentsia' always looks down with a really
limitless condescension on anyone who has not been dragged through the obligatory
schools and had the necessary knowledge pumped into him. The question has
never been: What are the man's abilities? but: What has he learned? To these
'educated' people the biggest empty-head, if he is wrapped in enough diplomas,
is worth more than the brightest boy who happens to lack these costly envelopes.
And so it was easy for me to imagine how this ' educated ' world would confront
me, and in this I erred only in so far as even then I still regarded people
as better than in cold reality they for the most part unfortunately are.
As they are, to be sure, the exceptions, as everywhere else, shine all the
more brightly. Thereby, however, I learned always to distinguish between
the eternal students and the men of real ability.After two days of agonized pondering and reflection, I finally
came to the conviction that I had to take this step.It was the most decisive resolve of my life. From here there
was and could be no turning back.And so I registered as a member of the German Workers' Party
and received a provisional membership card with the number 7.


THE EXTENT of the fall of a body is always measured by the distance
between its momentary position and the one it originally occupied. The same
is true of nations and states. A decisive significance must be ascribed
to their previous position or rather elevation. Only what is accustomed
to rise above the common limit can fall and crash to a manifest low This
is what makes the collapse of the Reich so hard and terrible for every thinking
and feeling man, since it brought a crash from heights which today, in view
of the depths of our present degradation, are scarcely conceivable.The very founding of the Reich seemed gilded by the magic of
an event which uplifted the entire nation. After a series of incomparable
victories, a Reich was born for the sons and grandsons-a reward for immortal
heroism. Whether consciously or unconsciously, it matters not, the Germans
all had the feeling that this Reich, which did not owe its existence to
the trickery of parliamentary fractions, towered above the measure of other
states by the very exalted manner of its founding; for not in the cackling
of a parliamentary battle of words, but in the thunder and rumbling of the
front surrounding Paris was the solemn act performed: a proclamation of
our will, declaring that the Germans, princes and people, were resolved
in the future to constitute a Reich and once again to raise the imperial
crown to symbolic heights. And this was not done by cowardly murder; no
deserters and slackers were the founders of the Bismarckian state, but the
regiments at the front.This unique birth and baptism of fire in themselves surrounded
the Reich with a halo of historic glory such as only the oldest states-and
they but seldom-could boast.And what an ascent now began!Freedom on the outside provided daily bread within. The nation
became rich in numbers and earthly goods. The honor of the state, and with
it that of the whole people, was protected and shielded by an army which
could point most visibly to the difference from the former German Union.So deep is the downfall of the Reich and the German people that
everyone, as though seized by dizziness, seems to have lost feeling and
consciousness; people can scarcely remember the former height, so dreamlike
and unreal do the old greatness and glory seem compared to our present-day
misery Thus it is understandable that people are so blinded by the sublime
that they forget to look for the omens of the gigantic collapse which must
after all have been somehow present.Of course, this applies only to those for whom Germany was more
than a mere stop-over for making and spending money, since they alone can
feel the present condition as a collapse, while to the others it is the
long-desired fulfillment of their hitherto unsatisfied desires.The omens were then present and visible, though but very few
attempted to draw a certain lesson from them.Yet today this is more necessary than ever.The cure of a sickness can only be achieved if its cause is
known, and the same is true of curing political evils. To be sure, the outward
form of a sickness, its symptom which strikes the eye, is easier to see
and discover than the inner cause. And this is the reason why so many people
never go beyond the recognition of external effects and even confuse them
with the cause, attempting, indeed, to deny the existence of the latter.
Thus most of us primarily see the German collapse only in the general economic
misery and the consequences arising therefrom. Nearly every one of us must
personally suffer these-a cogent ground for every individual to understand
the catastrophe. Much less does the great mass see the collapse in its political,
cultural, ethical, and moral aspect. In this the feeling and understanding
of many fail completely.That this should be so among the broad masses may still pass,
but for even the circles of the intelligentsia to regard the German collapse
as primarily an 'economic catastrophe,' which can therefore be cured by
economic means, is one of the reasons why a recovery has hitherto been impossible.
Only when it is understood that here, too, economics is only of second or
third-rate importance, and the primary role falls to factors of politics,
ethics, morality, and blood, will we arrive at an understanding of the present
calamity, and thus also be able to find the ways and means for a cure.The question of the causes of the German collapse is, therefore,
of decisive importance, particularly for a political movement whose very
goal is supposed to be to quell the defeat.
But, in such research into the past, we must be very careful not to confuse
the more conspicuous effects with the less visible causes.The easiest and hence most widespread explanation of the present
misfortune is that it was brought about by the consequences of the lost
War and that therefore the War is the cause of the present evil.There may be many who will seriously believe this nonsense but
there are still more from whose mouth such an explanation can only be a
lie and conscious falsehood. This last applies to all those who today feed
at the government's cribs. For didn't the prophets of the revolution again
and again point out most urgently to the people that it was a matter of
complete indifference to the broad masses how this War turned out? Did they
not, on the contrary, gravely assure us that at most the 'big capitalist'
could have an interest in a victorious end of the gigantic struggle of nations,
but never the German people as such, let alone the German worker? Indeed,
didn't these apostles of world conciliation maintain the exact opposite:
didn't they say that by a German defeat 'militarism' would be destroyed,
but that the German nation would celebrate its most glorious resurrection?
Didn't these circles glorify the benevolence of the Entente, and didn't
they shove tile blame for the whole bloody struggle on Germany? And could
they have done this without declaring that even military defeat would be
without special consequences for the nation? Wasn't the whole revolution
embroidered with the phrase that it would prevent the victory of the German
flag, but that through it the German people would at last begin advancing
toward freedom at home and abroad?Will you claim that this was not so, you wretched, lying scoundrels?It takes a truly Jewish effrontery to attribute the blame for
the collapse solely to the military defeat when the central organ of all
traitors to the nation, the Berlin Vorwarts, wrote that this time the German
people must not bring its banner home victorious!And now this is supposed to be the cause of our collapse?Of course, it would be perfectly futile to fight with such forgetful
liars. I wouldn't waste my words on them if unfortunately this nonsense
were not parroted by so many thoughtless people, who do not seem inspired
by malice or conscious insincerity. Furthermore, these discussions are intended
to give our propaganda fighters an instrument which is very much needed
at a time when the spoken word is often twisted in our mouths.Thus we have the following to say to the assertion that the
lost War is responsible for the German collapse:Certainly the loss of the War was of terrible importance for
the future of our fatherland; however, its loss is not a cause, but itself
only a consequence of causes. It was perfectly clear to everyone with insight
and without malice that an unfortunate end of this struggle for life and
death would inevitably lead to extremely devastating consequences. But unfortunately
there were also people who seemed to lack this insight at the right time
or who, contrary to their better knowledge, contested and denied this truth.
Such for the most part were those who, after the fulfillment of their secret
wish, suddenly and belatedly became aware of the catastrophe which had been
brought about by themselves among others. They are guilty of the collapse-not
the lost War as it suddenly pleases them to say and believe. For its loss
was, after all, only the consequence of their activity and not, as they
now try to say, the result of 'bad' leadership. The foe did not consist
of cowards either; he, too, knew how to die. His number from the first day
was greater than that of the German army for he could draw on the technical
armament and the arsenals of the whole world; hence the German victories,
won for four years against a whole world, must regardless of all heroic
courage and 'organization,' be attributed solely to superior leadership,
and this iS a fact which cannot be denied out of existence. The organization
and leadership of the German army were the mightiest that the earth had
ever seen. Their deficiencies lay in the limits of all human adequacy in
general.The collapse of this army was not the cause of our present-day
misfortune, but only the consequence of other crimes, a consequence which
itself again, it must be admitted, ushered in the beginning of a further
and this time visible collapse.The truth of this can be seen from the following:Must a military defeat lead to so complete a collapse of a nation
and a state? Since when is this the result of an unfortunate war? Do peoples
perish in consequence of lost wars as such?The answer to this can be very brief: always, when military
defeat iS the payment meted out to peoples for their inner rottenness, cowardice,
lack of character, in short, unworthiness. If this iS not the case, the
military defeat will rather be the inspiration of a great future resurrection
than the tombstone of a national existence.History offers innumerable examples for the truth of this assertion.Unfortunately, the military defeat of the German people is not
an undeserved catastrophe, but the deserved chastisement of eternal retribution.
We more than deserved this defeat. It is only the greatest outward symptom
of decay amid a whole series of inner symptoms, which perhaps had remained
hidden and invisible to the eyes of most people, or which like ostriches
people did not want to see.Just consider the attendant circumstances amid which the German
people accepted this defeat. Didn't many circles express the most shameless
joy at the misfortune of the fatherland? And who would do such a thing if
he does not really deserve such a punishment? Why, didn't they go even further
and brag of having finally caused the front to waver? And it was not the
enemy that did this-no, no, it was Germans who poured such disgrace upon
their heads! Can it be said that misfortune struck them unjustly? Since
when do people step forward and take the guilt for a war on themselves?
And against better knowledge and better judgment!No, and again no. In the way in which the German people received
its defeat, we can recognize most clearly that the true cause of our collapse
must be sought in an entirely different place from the purely military loss
of a few positions or in the failure of an offensive; for if the front as
such had really flagged and if its downfall had really encompassed the doom
of the fatherland, the German people would have received the defeat quite
differently. Then they would have borne the ensuing misfortune with gritted
teeth or would have mourned it, overpowered by grief; then all hearts would
have been filled with rage and anger toward the enemy who had become victorious
through a trick of chance or the will of fate; then, like the Roman Senate,
the nation would have received the defeated divisions with the thanks of
the fatherland for the sacrifices they had made and besought them not to
despair of the Reich. The capitulation would have been signed only with
the reason, while the heart even then would have beaten for the resurrection
to come.This is how a defeat for which only fate was responsible would
have been received. Then people would not have laughed and danced, they
would not have boasted of cowardice and glorified the defeat, they would
not have scoffed at the embattled troops and dragged their banner and cockade
in the mud. But above all: then we should never have had the terrible state
of affairs which prompted a British officer, Colonel Repington, to make
the contemptuous statement: 'Of the Germans, every third man is a traitor.'
No, this plague would never have been able to rise into the stifling flood
which for five years now has been drowning the very last remnant of respect
for us on the part of the rest of the world.This most of all shows the assertion that the lost War was the
cause of the German collapse to be a lie. No, this military collapse was
itself only the consequence of a large number of symptoms of disease and
their causes, which even in peacetime were with the German nation. This
was the first consequence, catastrophic and visible to all, of an ethical
and moral poisoning, of a diminution in the instinct of self-preservation
and its preconditions, which for many years had begun to undermine the foundations
of the people and the Reich.It required the whole bottomless falsehood of the Jews and their
Marxist fighting organization to lay the blame for the collapse on that
very man who alone, with superhuman energy and will power, tried to prevent
the catastrophe he foresaw and save the nation from its time of deepest
humiliation and disgrace By branding Ludendorff as guilty for the loss of
the World War they took the weapon of moral right from the one dangerous
accuser who could have risen against the traitors to the fatherland. In
this they proceeded on the sound principle that the magnitude of a lie always
contains a certain factor of credibility, since the great masses of the
people in the very bottom of their hearts tend to be corrupted rather than
consciously and purposely evil, and that, therefore, in view of the primitive
simplicity of their minds they more easily fall a victim to a big lie than
to a little one, since they themselves lie in little things, but would be
ashamed of lies that were too big. Such a falsehood will never enter their
heads and they will not be able to believe in the possibility of such monstrous
effrontery and infamous misrepresentation in others; yes, even when enlightened
on the subject, they will long doubt and waver, and continue to accept at
least one of these causes as true. Therefore, something of even the most
insolent lie will always remain and stick-a fact which all the great lie-virtuosi
and lying-clubs in this world know only too well and also make the most
treacherous use of.The foremost connoisseurs of this truth regarding the possibilities
in the use of falsehood and slander have always been the Jews; for after
all, their whole existence is based on one single great lie, to wit, that
they are a religious community while actually they are a race-and what a
race ! One of the greatest minds of humanity has nailed them forever as
such in an eternally correct phrase of fundamental truth: he called them
'the great masters of the lie.' And anyone who does not recognize this or
does not want to believe it will never in this world be able to help the
truth to victory.
For the German people it must almost be considered a great good fortune
that its period of creeping sickness was suddenly cut short by so terrible
a catastrophe, for otherwise the nation would have gone to the dogs more
slowly perhaps, but all the more certainly. The disease would have become
chronic, while in the acute form of the collapse it at least became clearly
and distinctly recognizable to a considerable number of people. It was no
accident that man mastered the plague more easily than tuberculosis. The
one comes in terrible waves of death that shake humanity to the foundations,
the other slowly and stealthily; the one leads to terrible fear, the other
to gradual indifference. The consequence is that man opposed the one with
all the ruthlessness of his energy, while he tries to control consumption
with feeble means. Thus he mastered the plague, while tuberculosis masters
him.Exactly the same is true of diseases of national bodies. If
they do not take the form of catastrophe, man slowly begins to get accustomed
to them and at length, though it may take some time, perishes all the more
certainly of them. And so it is a good fortune-though a bitter one, to be
sure-when Fate resolves to take a hand in this slow process of putrefaction
and with a sudden blow makes the victim visualize the end of his disease.
For more than once, that is what such a catastrophe amounts to Then it can
easily become the cause of a recovery beginning with the utmost determination.But even in such a case, the prerequisite is again the recognition
of the inner grounds which cause the disease in question.Here, too, the most important thing remains the distinction
between the causes and the conditions they call forth. This will be all
the more difficult, the longer the toxins remain in the national body and
the more they become an ingredient of it which is taken for granted. For
it is easily possible that after a certain time unquestionably harmful poisons
Bill be regarded as an ingredient of one's own nation or at best will be
tolerated as a necessary evil, so that a search for the alien virus is no
longer regarded as necessary.Thus, in the long peace of the pre-War years, certain harmful
features had appeared and been recognized as such, though next to nothing
was done against their virus, aside from a few exceptions. And here again
these exceptions were primarily manifestations of economic life, which struck
the consciousness of the individual more strongly than the harmful features
in a number of other fields.There were many symptoms of decay which should have aroused
serious reflection.With respect to economics, the following should be said:Through the amazing increase in the German population before
the War, the question of providing the necessary daily bread stepped more
and more sharply into the foreground of all political and economic thought
and action. Unfortunately, those in power could not make up their minds
to choose the only correct solution, but thought they could reach their
goal in an easier way. When they renounced the acquisition of new soil and
replaced it by the lunacy of world economic conquest, the result was bound
to be an industrialization as boundless as it was harmful.The first consequence of gravest importance was the weakening
of the peasant class. Proportionately as the peasant class diminished, the
mass of the big city proletariat increased more and more, until finally
the balance was completely upset.Now the abrupt alternation between rich and poor became really
apparent. Abundance and poverty lived so close together that the saddest
consequences could and inevitably did arise. Poverty and frequent unemployment
began to play havoc with people, leaving behind them a memory of discontent
and embitterment. The consequence of this seemed to be political class division.
Despite all the economic prosperity, dissatisfaction became greater and
deeper; in fact, things came to such a pass that the conviction that 'it
can't go on like this much longer' became general, yet without people having
or being able to have any definite idea of what ought to have been done.These were the typical symptoms of deep discontent which sought
to express themselves in this way.But worse than this were other consequences induced by the economization
of the nation.In proportion as economic life grew to be the dominant mistress
of the state, money became the god whom all had to serve and to whom each
man had to bow down. More and more, the gods of heaven were put into the
corner as obsolete and outmoded, and in their stead incense was burned to
the idol Mammon. A truly malignant degeneration set in; what made it most
malignant was that it began at a time when the nation, in a presumably menacing
and critical hour, needed the highest heroic attitude. Germany had to accustom
herself to the idea that some day her attempt to secure her daily bread
by means of 'peaceful economic labor' would have to be defended by the sword.Unfortunately, the domination of money was sanctioned even by
that authority which should have most opposed it: His Majesty the Kaiser
acted most unfortunately by drawing the aristocracy into the orbit of the
new finance capital. It must be said to his credit, however, that unfortunately
even Bismarck himself did not recognize the menacing danger in this respect.
Thereby the ideal virtues for all practical purposes had taken a position
second to the value of money, for it was clear that once a beginning had
been made in this direction, the aristocracy of the sword would in a short
time inevitably be overshadowed by the financial aristocracy. Financial
operations succeed more easily than battles. It was no longer inviting for
the real hero or statesman to be brought into relations with some old bank
Jew: the man of true ment could no longer have an interest in the bestowal
of cheap decorations; he declined them with thanks. But regarded purely
from the standpoint of blood, such a development was profoundly unfortunate:
more and more, the nobility lost the racial basis for its existence, and
in large measure the designation of 'ignobility' would have been more suitable
for it.A grave economic symptom of decay was the slow disappearance
of the right of private property, and the gradual transference of the entire
economy to the ownership of stock companies.Now for the first time labor had sunk to the level of an object
of speculation for unscrupulous Jewish business men; the alienation of property
from the wage-worker was increased ad infinitum. The stock exchange began
to triumph and prepared slowly but surely to take the life of the nation
into its guardianship and control.The internationalization of the German economic life had been
begun even before the War through the medium of stock issues To be sure,
a part of German industry still attempted with resolution to ward off this
fate. At length, however, it, too, fell a victim to the united attack of
greedy finance capital which carried on this fight, with the special help
of its most faithful comrade, the Marxist movement.The lasting war against German 'heavy industry' was the visible
beginning of the internationalization of German economy toward which Marxism
was striving, though this could not be carried to its ultimate end until
the victory of Marxism and the revolution. While I am writing these words,
the general attack against the German state railways has finally succeeded,
and they are now being handed over to international finance capitals 'International'
Social Democracy has thus realized one of its highest goals.How far this 'economization' of the German people had succeeded
is most visible in the fact that after the War one of the leading heads
of German industry, and above all of commerce, was finally able to express
the opinion that economic effort as such was alone in a position to re-establish
Germany. This nonsense was poured forth at a moment when France was primarily
bringing back the curriculum of her schools to humanistic foundations in
order to combat the error that the nation and the state owed their survival
to economics and not to eternal ideal values. These words pronounced by
a Stinnes created the most incredible confusion; they were picked up at
once, and with amazing rapidity became the leitmotif of all the quacks and
big-mouths that since the revolution Fate has let loose on Germany in the
capacity of 'statesmen.'One of the worst symptoms of decay in Germany of the pre-War
era was the steadily increasing habit of doing things by halves. This is
always a consequence of uncertainty on some matter and of the cowardice
resulting from this and other grounds. This disease was-further promoted
by education.German education before the War was afflicted with an extraordinary
number of weaknesses. It was extremely one-sided and adapted to breeding
pure 'knowledge,' with less attention to 'ability.' Even less emphasis was
laid on the development of the character of the individual-in so far as
this is possible; exceedingly little on the sense of joy in responsibility,
and none at all on the training of will and force of decision. Its results,
you may be sure, were not strong men, but compliant ' walking encyclopedias,'
as we Germans were generally looked upon and accordingly estimated before
the War. People liked the German because he was easy to make use of, but
respected him little, precisely because of his weakness of will. It was
not for nothing that more than almost any other people he was prone to lose
his nationality and fatherland. The lovely proverb, 'with hat in hand, he
travels all about the land,' tells the whole story.This compliance became really disastrous, however, when it determined
the sole form in which the monarch could be approached; that is, never to
contradict him, but agree to anything and everything that His Majesty condescends
to do. Precisely in this place was free, manly dignity most necessary; otherwise
the monarchic institution was one day bound to perish from all this crawling;
for crawling it was and nothing else! And only miserable crawlers and sneaks-in
short, all the decadents who have always felt more at ease around the highest
thrones than sincere, decent, honorable souls-can regard this as the sole
proper form of intercourse with the bearers of the crown! These 'most humble'
creatures, to be sure, despite all their humility before their master and
source of livelihood, have always demonstrated the greatest arrogance toward
the rest of humanity, and worst of all when they pass themselves off with
shameful effrontery on their sinful fellow men as the only 'monarchists';
this is real gall such as only these ennobled or even unennobled tapeworms
are capable of! For in reality these people remained the gravediggers of
the monarchy and particularly the monarchistic idea. Nothing else is conceivable:
a man who is prepared to stand up for a cause will never and can never be
a sneak and a spineless lickspittle. Anyone who is really serious about
the preservation and furtherance of an institution will cling to it with
the last fiber of his heart and will not be able to abandon it if evils
of some sort appear in this institution. To be sure, he will not cry this
out to the whole public as the democratic 'friends' of the monarchy did
in the exact same lying way; he will most earnestly warn and attempt to
influence His Majesty, the bearer of the crown himself. He will not and
must not adopt the attitude that His Majesty remains free to act according
to his own will anyway, even if this obviously must and will lead to a catastrophe,
but in such a case he will have to protect the monarchy against the monarch,
and this despite all perils. If the value of this institution lay in the
momentary person of the monarch, it would be the worst institution that
can be imagined; for monarchs only in the rarest cases are the cream of
wisdom and reason or even of character, as some people like to claim. This
is believed only by professional lickspittles and sneaks, but all straightforward
men-and these remain the most valuable men in the state despite everything-
will only feel repelled by the idea of arguing such nonsense. For them history
remains history and the truth the truth even where monarchs are concerned.
No, the good fortune to possess a great monarch who is also a great man
falls to peoples so seldom that they must be content if the malice of Fate
abstains at least from the worst possible mistakes.Consequently, the value and importance of the monarchic idea
cannot reside in the person of the monarch himself except if Heaven decides
to lay the crown on the brow of a heroic genius like Frederick the Great
or a wise character like William I. This happens once in centuries and hardly
more often. Otherwise the idea takes precedence over the person and the
meaning of this institution must lie exclusively in the institution itself.
With this the monarch himself falls into the sphere of service. Then he,
too, becomes a mere cog in this work, to which he is obligated as such.
Then he, too, must comply with a higher purpose, and the ' monarchist' is
then no longer the man who in silence lets the bearer of the crown profane
it, but the man who prevents this. Otherwise, it would not be permissible
to depose an obviously insane prince, if the sense of the institution lay
not in the idea, but in the ' sanctified ' person at any price.Today it is really necessary to put this down, for in recent
times more and more of these creatures, to whose wretched attitude the collapse
of the monarchy must not least of all be attributed are rising out of obscurity.
With a certain naive gall, these people have started in again to speak of
nothing but 'their King'- whom only a few years ago they left in the lurch
in the critical hour and in the most despicable fashion-and are beginning
to represent every person who is not willing to agree to their lying tirades
as a bad German. And in reality they are the very same poltroons who in
1919 scattered and ran from every red armband, abandoned their King, in
a twinkling exchanged the halberd for the walking stick, put on noncommittal
neckties, and vanished without trace as peaceful ' citizens.' At one stroke
they were gone, these royal champions, and only after the revolutionary
storm, thanks to the activity of others, had subsided enough so that a man
could again roar his 'Hail, hail to the King' into the breezes, these 'servants
and counselors' of the crown began again cautiously to emerge. And now they
are all here again, looking back longingly to the fieshpots of Egypt; they
can hardly restrain themselves in their loyalty to the King and their urge
to do great things, until the day when again the first red arm-band will
appear, and the whole gang of ghosts profiting from the old monarchy will
again vanish like mice at the sight of a cat!If the monarchs were not themselves to blame for these things,
they could be most heartily pitied because of their present defenders. In
any case, they might as well know that with such knights a crown can be
lost, but no crowns gained.This servility, however, was a flaw in our whole education,
for which we suffered most terribly in this connection. For, as its consequence,
these wretched creatures were able to maintain themselves at all the courts
and gradually undermine the foundations of the monarchy. And when the structure
finally began to totter, they evaporated. Naturally: cringers and lickspittles
do not let themselves be knocked dead for their master. That monarchs never
know this and fail to learn it almost on principle has from time immemorial
been their undoing.One of the worst symptoms of decay was Mate increasing cowardice
in the face of responsibility, as well as the resultant halfheartedness
in all things.To be sure, the starting point of this plague in our country
lies in large part in the parliamentary institution in which irresponsibility
of the purest breed is cultivated. Unfortunately, this plague slowly spread
to all other domains of life, most strongly to state life. Everywhere responsibility
was evaded and inadequate half-measures were preferred as a result; for
in the use of such measures personal responsibility seems reduced to the
smallest dimensions.Just examine the attitude of the various governments toward
a number of truly injurious manifestations of our public life, and you will
easily recognize the terrible significance of this general half-heartedness
and cowardice in the face of responsibility.I shall take only a few cases from the mass of existing examples:Journalistic circles in particular like to describe the press
as a 'great power' in the state. As a matter of fact, its importance really
is immense. It cannot be overestimated, for the press really continues education
in adulthood.Its readers, by and large, can be divided into three groups:First, into those who believe everything they read;second, into those who have ceased to believe anything;third, into the minds which critically examine what they read,
and judge accordingly.Numerically, the first group is by far the largest. It consists
of the great mass of the people and consequently represents the simplest-minded
part of the nation. It cannot be listed in terms of professions, but at
most in general degrees of intelligence. To it belong all those who have
neither been born nor trained to think independently, and who partly from
incapacity and partly from incompetence believe everything that is set before
them in black and white. To them also belongs the type of lazybones who
could perfectly well think, but from sheer mental laziness seizes gratefully
on everything that someone else has thought, with the modest assumption
that the someone else has exerted himself considerably. Now, with all these
types, who constitute the great masses, the influence of the press will
be enormous. They are not able or willing themselves to examine what is
set before them, and as a result their whole attitude toward all the problems
of the day can be reduced almost exclusively to the outside influence of
others. This can be advantageous when their enlightenment is provided by
a serious and truth-loving party, but it is catastrophic when scoundrels
and liars provide it.The second group is much smaller in number. It is partly composed
of elements which previously belonged to the first group, but after long
and bitter disappointments shifted to the opposite and no longer believe
anything that comes before their eyes in print. They hate every newspaper;
either they don't read it at all, or without exception fly into a rage over
the contents, since in their opinion they consist only of lies and falsehoods.
These people are very hard to handle, since they are suspicious even in
the face of the truth. Consequently, they are lost for all positive, political
work.The third group, finally, is by far the smallest; it consists
of the minds with real mental subtlety, whom natural gifts and education
have taught to think independently, who try to form their own judgment on
all things, and who subject everything they read to a thorough examination
and further development of their own. They will not look at a newspaper
without always collaborating in their minds, and the writer has no easy
time of it. Journalists love such readers with the greatest reserve.
For the members of this third group, it must be admitted, the nonsense that
newspaper scribblers can put down is not very dangerous or even very important.
Most of them in the course of their lives have learned to regard every journalist
as a rascal on principle, who tells the truth only once in a blue moon.
Unfortunately, however, the importance of these splendid people lies only
in their intelligence and not in their number- a misfortune at a time when
wisdom is nothing and the majority is everything! Today, when the ballot
of the masses decides, the chief weight lies with the most numerous group,
and this is the first: the mob of the simple or credulous.It is of paramount interest to the state and the nation to prevent
these people from falling into the hands of bad, ignorant, or even vicious
educators. The state, therefore, has the duty of watching over their education
and preventing any mischief. It must particularly exercise strict control
over the press; for its influence on these people is by far the strongest
and most penetrating, since it is applied, not once in a while, but over
and over again. In the uniformity and constant repetition of this instruction
lies its tremendous power. If anywhere, therefore, it is here that the state
must not forget that all means must serve an end; it must not let itself
be confused by the drivel about so-called 'freedom of the press' and let
itself be talked into neglecting its duty and denying the nation the food
which it needs and which is good for it; with ruthless determination it
must make sure of this instrument of popular education, and place it in
the service of the state and the nation.But what food did the German press of the pre-War period dish
out to the people? Was it not the worst poison that can even be imagined?
Wasn't the worst kind of pacifism injected into the heart of our people
at a time when the rest of the world was preparing to throttle Germany,
slowly but surely? Even in peacetime didn't the press inspire the minds
of the people with doubt in the right of their own state, thus from the
outset limiting them in the choice of means for its defense? Was it not
the German press which knew how to make the absurdity of 'Western democracy'
palatable to our people until finally, ensnared by all the enthusiastic
tirades, they thought they could entrust their future to a League of Nations?
Did it not help to teach our people a miserable immorality? Did it not ridicule
morality and ethics as backward and petty-bourgeois, until our people finally
became 'modern'? Did it not with its constant attacks undermine the foundations
of the state's authority until a single thrust sufficed to make the edifice
collapse? Did it not fight with all possible means against every effort
to give unto the state that which is the state's? Did it not belittle the
army with constant criticism, sabotage universal conscription, demand the
refusal of military credits, etc., until the result became inevitable?The so-called liberal press was actively engaged in digging
the grave of the German people and the German Reich. We can pass by the
lying Marxist sheets in silence; to them lying is just as vitally necessary
as catching mice for a cat; their function is only to break the people's
national and patriotic backbone and make them ripe for the slave's yoke
of international capital and its masters, the Jews.And what did the state do against this mass poisoning of the
nation? Nothing, absolutely nothing. A few ridiculous decrees, a few fines
for villainy that went too far, and that was the end of it. Instead, they
hoped to curry favor with this plague by flattery, by recognition of the
'value' of the press, its 'importance,' its 'educational mission,' and more
such nonsense-as for the Jews, they took all this with a crafty smile and
acknowledged it with sly thanks.The reason, however, for this disgraceful failure on the part
of the state was not that it did not recognize the danger, but rather in
a cowardice crying to high Heaven and the resultant halfheartedness of all
decisions and measures. No one had the courage to use thoroughgoing radical
methods, but in this as in everything else they tinkered about with a lot
of halfway prescriptions, and instead of carrying the thrust to the heart,
they at most irritated the viper-with the result that not only did everything
remain as before, but on the contrary the power of the institutions which
should have been combated increased from year to year.The defensive struggle of the German government at that time
against the press-mainly that of Jewish origin-which was slowly ruining
the nation was without any straight line, irresolute and above all without
any visible goal. The intelligence of the privy councilors failed completely
when it came to estimating the importance of this struggle, to choosing
means or drawing up a clear plan. Planlessly they fiddled about; sometimes,
after being bitten too badly, they locked up one of the journalistic vipers
for a few weeks or months, but they left the snakes' nest as such perfectly
unmolested.True-this resulted partly from the infinitely wily tactics of
the Jews, on the one hand, and from a stupidity and innocence such as only
privy councilors are capable of, on the other. The Jew was much too clever
to allow his entire press to be attacked uniformly. No, one part of it existed
in order to cover the other. While the Marxist papers assailed in the most
dastardly way everything that can be holy to man; while they infamously
attacked the state and the government and stirred up large sections of the
people against one another, the bourgeois-democratic papers knew how to
give an appearance of their famous objectivity, painstakingly avoided all
strong words, well knowing that empty heads can judge only by externals
and never have the faculty of penetrating the inner core, so that for them
the value of a thing is measured by this exterior instead of by the content;
a human weakness to which they owe what esteem they themselves enjoy.For these people the Frankfurter Zeitung was the embodiment
of respectability. For it never uses coarse expressions, it rejects all
physical brutality and keeps appealing for struggle with 'intellectual'
weapons, a conception, strange to say, to which especially the least intelligent
people are most attached. This is a result of our half-education which removes
people from the instinct of Nature and pumps a certain amount of knowledge
into them, but cannot create full understanding, since for this industry
and good will alone are no use; the necessary intelligence must be present,
and what is more, it must be inborn. The ultimate wisdom is always the understanding
of the instinct '-that is: a man must never fall into the lunacy of believing
that he has really risen to be lord and master of Nature-which is so easily
induced by the conceit of half-education; he must understand the fundamental
necessity of Nature's rule, and realize how much his existence is subjected
to these laws of eternal fight and upward struggle. Then he will feel that
in a universe where planets revolve around suns, and moons turn about planets,
where force alone forever masters weakness, compelling it to be an obedient
slave or else crushing it, there can be no special laws for man. For him,
too, the eternal principles of this ultimate wisdom hold sway. He can try
to comprehend them; but escape them, never.And it is precisely for our intellectual demi-monde that the
Jew writes his so-called intellectual press. For them the Frankfurter Zeitung
and the Berliner Tageblatt are made; for them their tone is chosen, and
on them they exercise their influence. Seemingly they all most sedulously
avoid any outwardly crude forms, and meanwhile from other vessels they nevertheless
pour their poison into the hearts of their readers. Amid a Gezeires 2 Of
fine sounds and phrases they lull their readers into believing that pure
science or even morality is really the motive of their acts, while in reality
it is nothing but a wily, ingenious trick for stealing the enemy's weapon
against the press from under his nose. The one variety oozes respectability,
so all soft-heads are ready to believe them when they say that the faults
of others are only trivial abuses which should never lead to an infringement
of the 'freedom of the press'-their term for poisoning and lying to the
people. And so the authorities shy away from taking measures against these
bandits, for they fear that, if they did, they would at once have the '
respectable ' press against them, a fear which is only too justified. For
as soon as they attempt to proceed against one of these shameful rags, all
the others will at once take its part, but by no means to sanction its mode
of struggle, God forbid-but only to defend the principle of freedom of the
press and freedom of public opinion; these alone must be defended. But in
the face of all this shouting, the strongest men grow weak, for does it
not issue from the mouths of 'respectable' papers?This poison was able to penetrate the bloodstream of our people
unhindered and do its work, and the state did not possess the power to master
the disease. In the laughable half-measures which it used against the poison,
the menacing decay of the Reich was manifest. For an institution which is
no longer resolved to defend itself with all weapons has for practical purposes
abdicated. Every half-measure is a visible sign of inner decay which must
and will be followed sooner or later by outward collapse.I believe that the present generation, properly led, will more
easily master this danger. It has experienced various things which had the
power somewhat to strengthen the nerves of those who did not lose them entirely.
In future days the Jew will certainly continue to raise a mighty uproar
in his newspapers if a hand is ever laid on his favorite nest, if an end
is put to the mischief of the press and this instrument of education is
put into the service of the state and no longer left in the hands of aliens
and enemies of the people. But I believe that this will bother us younger
men less than our fathers. A thirty-centimeter shell has always hissed more
loudly than a thousand Jewish newspaper vipers-so let them hiss!A further example of the halfheartedness and weakness of
the leaders of pre-War Germany in meeting the most important vital questions
of the nation is the following: running parallel to the political, ethical,
and moral contamination of the people, there had been for many years a no
less terrible poisoning of the health of the national body. Especially in
the big cities, syphilis was beginning to spread more and more, while tuberculosis
steadily reaped its harvest of death throughout nearly the whole country.Though in both cases the consequences were terrible for the
nation, the authorities could not summon up the energy to take
decisive measures.Particularly with regard to syphilis, the attitude of the leadership
of the nation and the state can only be designated as total capitulation.
To fight it seriously, they would have had to take somewhat broader measures
than was actually the case. The invention of a remedy of questionable character
and its commercial exploitation can no longer help much against this plague.
Here again it was only the fight against causes that mattered and not the
elimination of the symptoms. The cause lies, primarily, in our prostitution
of love. Even if its result were not this frightful plague, it would nevertheless
be profoundly injurious to man, since the moral devastations which accompany
this degeneracy suffice to destroy a people slowly but surely. This Jewification
of our spiritual life and mammonization of our mating instinct will sooner
or later destroy our entire offspring, for the powerful children of a natural
emotion will be replaced by the miserable creatures of financial expediency
which is becoming more and more the basis and sole prerequisite of our marriages.
Love finds its outlet elsewhere.Here, too, of course, Nature can be scorned for a certain time,
but her vengeance will not fail to appear, only it takes a time to manifest
itself, or rather: it is often recognized too late by man.But the devastating consequences of a lasting disregard of the
natural requirements for marriage can be seen in our nobility. Here we have
before us the results of procreation based partly on purely social compulsion
and partly on financial grounds. The one leads to a general weakening, the
other to a poisoning of the blood, since every department store Jewess is
considered fit to augment the offspring of His Highness-and, indeed, the
offspring look it. In both cases complete degeneration is the consequence.Today our bourgeoisie strive to go the same road, and they will
end up at the same goal.Hastily and indifferently, people tried to pass by the unpleasant
truths, as though by such an attitude events could be undone. No, the fact
that our big city population is growing more and more prostituted in its
love life cannot just be denied out of existence; it simply is so. The most
visible results of this mass contamination can, on the one hand, be found
in the insane asylums, and on the other, unfortunately, in our-children.
They in particular are the sad product of the irresistibly spreading contamination
of our sexual life; the vices of the parents are revealed in the sicknesses
of the children.There are different ways of reconciling oneself to this unpleasant,
yes, terrible fact: the ones see nothing at all or rather want to see nothing;
this, of course, is by far the simplest and easiest 'position.' The others
wrap themselves in a saint's cloak of prudishness as absurd as it is hypocritical;
they speak of this whole field as if it were a great sin, and above all
express their profound indignation against every sinner caught in the act,
then close their eyes in pious horror to this godless plague and pray God
to let sulphur and brimstone-preferably after their own death-rain down
on this whole Sodom and Gomorrah, thus once again making an instructive
example of this shameless humanity. The third, finally, are perfectly well
aware of the terrible consequences which this plague must and will some
day induce, but only shrug their shoulders, convinced that nothing can be
done against the menace, so the only thing to do is to let things slide.All this, to be sure, is comfortable and simple, but it must
not be forgotten that a nation will fall victim to such comfortableness.
The excuse that other peoples are no better off, it goes without saying,
can scarcely affect the fact of our own ruin, except that the feeling of
seeing others stricken by the same calamity might for many bring a mitigation
of their own pains. But then more than ever the question becomes: Which
people will be the first and only one to master this plague by its own strength,
and which nations will perish from it? And this is the crux of the whole
matter. Here again we have a touchstone of a race's value-the race which
cannot stand the test will simply die out, making place for healthier or
tougher and more resisting races. For since this question primarily regards
the offspring, it is one of those concerning which it is said with such
terrible justice that the sins of the fathers are avenged down to the tenth
generation. But this applies only to profanation of the blood and the race.Blood sin and desecration of the race are the original sin in
this world and the end of a humanity which surrenders to it.How truly wretched was the attitude of pre-War Germany on this
one very question ! What was done to check the contamination of our youth
in the big cities? What was done to attack the infection and mammonization
of our love life? What was done to combat the resulting syphilization of
our people?This can be answered most easily by stating what should have
been done.First of all, it was not permissible to take this question frivolously;
it had to be understood that the fortune or misfortune of generations would
depend on its solution; yes, that it could, if not had to be, decisive for
the entire future of our people. Such a realization, however, obligated
us to ruthless measures and surgical operations. What we needed most was
the conviction that first of all the whole attention of the nation had to
be concentrated upon this terrible danger, so that every single individual
could become inwardly conscious of the importance of this struggle. Truly
incisive and sometimes almost unbearable obligations and burdens can only
be made generally effective if, in addition to compulsion, the realization
of necessity is transmitted to the individual. But this requires a tremendous
enlightenment excluding all other problems of the day which might have a
distracting effect.In all cases where the fulfillment of apparently impossible
demand.s or tasks is involved, the whole attention of a people must be focused
and concentrated on this one question, as though life and death actually
depended on its solution. Only in this way will a people be made willing
and able to perform great tasks and exertions.This principle applies also to the individual man in so far
as he wants to achieve great goals. He, too, will be able to do this only
in steplike sections, and he, too, will always have to unite his entire
energies on the achievement of a definitely delimited task, until this task
seems fulfilled and a new section can be marked out. Anyone who does not
so divide the road to be conquered into separate stages and does not try
to conquer these one by one, systematically with the sharpest concentration
of all his forces, will never be able to reach the ultimate goal, but will
be left lying somewhere along the road, or perhaps even off it. This gradual
working up to a goal is an art, and to conquer the road step by step in
this way you must throw in your last ounce of energy.The very first prerequisite needed for attacking such a difficult
stretch of the human road is for the leadership to succeed in representing
to the masses of the people the partial goal which now has to be achieved,
or rather conquered, as the one which is solely and alone worthy of attention,
on whose conquest everything depends. The great mass of the people cannot
see the whole road ahead of them without growing weary and despairing of
the task. A certain number of them will keep the goal in mind, but will
only be able to see the road in small, partial stretches, like the wanderer,
who likewise knows and recognizes the end of his journey, but is better
able to conquer the endless highway if he divides it into sections and boldly
attacks each one as though it represented the desired goal itself. Only
in this way does he advance without losing heart.Thus, by the use of all propagandist means, the question of
combating syphilis should have been made to appear as the task of the nation.
Not just one more task. To this end, its injurious effects should have been
thoroughly hammered into people as the most terrible misfortune, and this
by the use of all available means, until the entire nation arrived at the
conviction that everything-future or ruin-depended upon the solution of
this question.Only after such a preparation, if necessary over a period of
years, will the attention, and consequently the determination, of the entire
nation be aroused to such an extent that we can take exceedingly hard measures
exacting the greatest sacrifices without running the risk of not being understood
or of suddenly being left in the lurch by the will of the masses.For, seriously to attack this plague, tremendous sacrifices
and equally great labors are necessary.The fight against syphilis demands a fight against prostitution
against prejudices, old habits, against previous conceptions, general views
among them not least the false prudery of certain circles.The first prerequisite for even the moral right to combat these
things is the facilitation of earlier marriage for the coming generation.
In late marriage alone lies the compulsion to retain an institution which,
twist and turn as you like, is and remains a disgrace to humanity, an institution
which is damned ill-suited to a being who with his usual modesty likes to
regard himself as the 'image' of God.Prostitution is a disgrace to humanity, but it cannot be eliminated
by moral lectures, pious intentions, etc.; its limitation and final abolition
presuppose the elimination of innumerable preconditions. The first is and
remains the creation of an opportunity for early marriage as compatible
with human nature- particularly for the man, as the woman in any case is
only the passive part.How lost, how incomprehensible a part of humanity has become
today can be seen from the fact that mothers in so-called 'good ' society
can not seldom be heard to say that they are glad to have found their child
a husband who has sown his wild oats, etc. Since there is hardly any lack
of these, but rather the contrary, the poor girl will be happy to find one
of these worn-out Siegfrieds, and the children will be the visible result
of this 'sensible' marriage. If we bear in mind that, aside from this, propagation
as such is limited as much as possible, so that Nature is prevented from
making any choice, since naturally every creature, regardless how miserable,
must be preserved, the only question that remains is why such an institution
exists at all any more and what purpose it is supposed to serve? Isn't it
exactly the same as prostitution itself? Hasn't duty toward posterity passed
completely out of the picture? Or do people fail to realize what a curse
on the part of their children and children's children they are heaping on
themselves by such criminal frivolity in observing the ultimate natural
law as well as our ultimate natural obligation?Thus, the civilized peoples degenerate and gradually perish.And marriage cannot be an end in itself, but must serve the
one higher goal, the increase and preservation of the species and the race.
This alone is its meaning and its task.Under these conditions its soundness can only be judged by the
way in which it fulfills this task. For this reason alone early marriage
is sound, for it-gives the young marriage that strength from which alone
a healthy and resistant offspring can arise. To be sure, it can be made
possible only by quite a number of social conditions without which early
marriage is not even thinkable. Therefore, a solution of this question,
small as it is, cannot occur without incisive measures of a social sort.
The importance of these should be most understandable at a time when the
'social' - republic, if only by its incompetence in the solution of the
housing question, simply prevents numerous marriages and thus encourages
prostitution.Our absurd way of regulating salaries, which concerns itself
much too little with the question of the family and its sustenance, is one
more reason that makes many an early marriage impossible.Thus, a real fight against prostitution can only be undertaken
if a basic change in social conditions makes possible an earlier marriage
than at present can generally take place. This is the very first premise
for a solution of this question.In the second place, education and training must eradicate a
number of evils about which today no one bothers at all. Above all, in our
present education a balance must be created between mental instruction and
physical training. The institution that is called a Gymnasium today is a
mockery of the Greek model. In our educational system it has been utterly
forgotten that in the long run a healthy mind can dwell only in a healthy
body. Especially if we bear in mind the mass of the people, aside from a
few exceptions, this statement becomes absolutely valid.In pre-War Germany there was a period in which no one concerned
himself in the least about this truth. They simply went on sinning against
the body and thought that in the one-sided training of the 'mind,' they
possessed a sure guaranty for the greatness of the nation. A mistake whose
consequences began to be felt sooner than was expected. It is no accident
that th Bolshevistic wave never found better soil than in places inhabited
by a population degenerated by hunger and constant undernourishment: in
Central Germany, Saxony, and the Ruhr. But in all these districts the so-called
intelligentsia no longer offers any serious resistance to this Jewish disease,
for the simple reason that this intelligentsia is itself completely degenerate
physically, though less for reasons of poverty than for reasons of education.
In times when not the mind but the fist decides, the purely intellectual
emphasis of our education in the upper classes makes them incapable of defending
themselves, let alone enforcing their will. Not infrequently the first reason
for personal cowardice lies in physical weaknesses.The excessive emphasis on purely intellectual instruction and
the neglect of physical training also encourage the emergence of sexual
ideas at a much too early age. The youth who achieves the hardness of iron
by sports and gymnastics succumbs to the need of sexual satisfaction less
than the stay-at-home fed exclusively on intellectual fare. And a sensible
system of education must bear this in mind. It must, moreover, not fail
to consider that the healthy young man will expect different things from
the woman than a prematurely corrupted weakling.Thus, the whole system of education must be so organized as
to use the boy's free time for the useful training of his body. He has no
right to hang about in idleness during these years, to make the streets
and movie-houses unsafe; after his day's work he should steel and harden
his young body, so that later life will not find him too soft. To begin
this and also carry it out, to direct and guide it, is the task of education,
and not just the pumping of so-called wisdom. We must also do away with
the conception that the treatment of the body is the affair of every individual.
There is no freedom to sin at the cost of posterity and hence of the race.Parallel to the training of the body, a struggle against the
poisoning of the soul must begin. Our whole public life today is like a
hothouse for sexual ideas and stimulations. Just look at the bill of fare
served up in our movies, vaudeville and theaters, and you will hardly be
able to deny that this is not the right kind of food, particularly for the
youth. In shop windows and billboards the vilest means are used to attract
the attention of the crowd. Anyone who has not lost the ability to think
himself into their soul must realize that this must cause great damage in
the youth. This sensual, sultry atmosphere leads to ideas and stimulations
at a time when the boy should have no understanding of such things. The
result of this kind of education can be studied in present-day youth, and
it is not exactly gratifying. They mature too early and consequently grow
old before their time. Sometimes the public learns of court proceedings
which permit shattering insights into the emotional life of our fourteen-
and fifteen-year-olds. Who will be surprised that even in these age-groups
syphilis begins to seek its victims? And is it not deplorable to see a good
number of these physically weak, spiritually corrupted young men obtaining
their introduction to marriage through big-city whores?No, anyone who wants to attack prostitution must first of all
help to eliminate its spiritual basis. He must clear away the filth of the
moral plague of big-city ' civilization ' and he must do this ruthlessly
and without wavering in the face of all the shouting and screaming that
will naturally be let loose. If we do not lift the youth out of the morass
of their present-day environment, they will drown in it. Anyone who refuses
to see these things supports them, and thereby makes himself an accomplice
in the slow prostitution of our future which, whether we like it or not,
lies in the coming generation. This cleansing of our culture must be extended
to nearly all fields. Theater, art, literature, cinema, press, posters,
and window displays must be cleansed of all manifestations of our rotting
world and placed in the service of a moral political, and cultural idea.
Public life must be freed from the stifling perfume of our modern eroticism,
just as it must be freed from all unmanly, prudish hypocrisy. In all these
things the goal and the road must be determined by concern for the preservation
of the health of our people in body and soul. The right of personal freedom
recedes before the duty to preserve the race.Only after these measures are carried out can the medical struggle
against the plague itself be carried through with any prospect of success.
But here, too, there must be no half-measures; the gravest and most ruthless
decisions will have to be made. It is a half-measure to let incurably sick
people steadily contaminate the remaining healthy ones. This is in keeping
with the humanitarianism which, to avoid hurting one individual, lets a
hundred others perish. The demand that defective people be prevented from
propagating equally defective offspring is a demand of the clearest reason
and if systematically executed represents the most humane act of mankind.
It will spare millions of unfortunates undeserved sufferings, and consequently
will lead to a rising improvement of health as a whole. The determination
to proceed in this direction will oppose a dam to the further spread of
venereal diseases. For, if necessary, the incurably sick will be pitilessly
segregated-a barbaric measure for the unfortunate who is struck by it, but
a blessing for his fellow men and posterity. The passing pain of a century
can and will redeem millenniums from sufferings.The struggle against syphilis and the prostitution which prepares
the way for it is one of the most gigantic tasks of humanity, gigantic because
we are facing, not the solution of a single question, but the elimination
of a large number of evils which bring about this plague as a resultant
manifestation. For in this case the sickening of the body is only the consequence
of a sickening of the moral, social, and racial instincts.But if out of smugness, or even cowardice, this battle is not
fought to its end, then take a look at the peoples five hundred years from
now. I think you will find but few images of God, unless you want to profane
the Almighty.But how did they try to deal with this plague in old Germany?
Viewed calmly, the answer is really dismal. Assuredly, government circles
well recognized the terrible evils, though perhaps they were not quite able
to ponder the consequences; but in the struggle against it they failed totally,
and instead of thoroughgoing reforms preferred to take pitiful measures.
They tinkered with the disease and left the causes untouched. They submitted
the individual prostitute to a medical examination, supervised her as best
they could, and, in case they established disease, put her in some hospital
from which after a superficial cure they again let her loose on the rest
of humanity.To be sure, they had introduced a 'protective paragraph' according
to which anyone who was not entirely healthy or cured must avoid sexual
intercourse under penalty of the law. Surely this measure is sound in itself,
but in its practical application it was almost a total failure. In the first
place, the woman, in case she is smitten by misfortune-if only due to our,
or rather her, education-will in most cases refuse to be dragged into court
as a witness against the wretched thief of her health-often under the most
embarrassing attendant circumstances. She, in particular, has little to
gain from it; in most cases she will be the one to suffer most-for she will
be struck much harder by the contempt of her loveless fellow creatures than
would be the case with a man. Finally, imagine the situation if the conveyor
of the disease is her own husband. Should she accuse him? Or what else should
she do?In the case of the man, there is the additional fact that unfortunately
he often runs across the path of this plague after ample consumption of
alcohol, since in this condition he is least able to judge the qualities
of his 'fair one,' a fact which is only too well known to the diseased prostitute,
and always causes her to angle after men in this ideal condition. And the
upshot of it all is that the man who gets an unpleasant surprise later can,
even by thoroughly racking his brains, not remember his kind benefactress,
which should not be surprising in a city like Berlin or even Munich. In
addition, it must be considered that often we have to deal with visitors
from the provinces who are completely befuddled by all the magic of the
big city.Finally, however: who can know whether he is sick or healthy?
Are there not numerous cases in which a patient apparently cured relapses
and causes frightful mischief without himself suspecting it at first?Thus, the practical effect of this protection by legal punishment
of a guilty infection is in reality practically nil. Exactly the same is
true of the supervision of prostitutes; and finally, the cure itself, even
today, is dubious. Only one thing is certain: despite all measures the plague
spread more and more, giving striking confirmation of their ineffectualness.The fight against the prostitution of the people's soul was
a failure all along the line, or rather, that is, nothing at all was done.Let anyone who is inclined to take this lightly just study the
basic statistical facts on the dissemination of this plague, compare its
growth in the last hundred years, and then imagine its further development-and
he would really need the simplicity of an ass to keep an unpleasant shudder
from running down his back.The weakness and halfheartedness of the position taken in old
Germany toward so terrible a phenomenon may be evaluated as a visible sign
of a people's decay. If the power to fight for one's own health is no longer
present, the right to live in this world of struggle ends. This world belongs
only to the forceful 'whole' man and not to the weak 'half ' man.One of the most obvious manifestations of decay in the old Reich
was the slow decline of the cultural level, and by culture I do not mean
what today is designated by the word ' civilization.' The latter, on the
contrary, rather seems hostile to a truly high standard of thinking and
living.Even before the turn of the century an element began to intrude
into our art which up to that time could be regarded as entirely foreign
and unknown. To be sure, even in earlier times there were occasional aberrations
of taste, but such cases were rather artistic derailments, to which posterity
could attribute at least a certain historical value, than products no longer
of an artistic degeneration, but of a spiritual degeneration that had reached
the point of destroying the spirit. In them the political collapse, which
later became more visible, was culturally indicated.Art Bolshevism is the only possible cultural form and spiritual
expression of Bolshevism as a whole.Anyone to whom this seems strange need only subject the art
of the happily Bolshevized states to an examination, and, to his horror,
he will be confronted by the morbid excrescences of insane and degenerate
men, with which, since the turn of the century, we have become familiar
under the collective concepts of cubism and dadaism, as the official and
recognized art of those states. Even in the short period of the Bavarian
Republic of Councils, this phenomenon appeared. Even here it could be seen
that all the official posters, propagandist drawings in the newspapers,
etc., bore the imprint, not only of political but of cultural decay.No more than a political collapse of the present magnitude would
have been conceivable sixty years ago was a cultural collapse such as began
to manifest itself in futurist and cubist works since 1900 thinkable. Sixty
years ago an exhibition of so-called dadaistic 'experiences' would have
seemed simply impossible and its organizers would have ended up in the madhouse,
while today they even preside over art associations. This plague could not
appear at that time, because neither would public opinion have tolerated
it nor the state calmly looked on. For it is the business of the state,
in other words, of its leaders, to prevent a people from being driven into
the arms of spiritual madness. And this is where such a development would
some day inevitably end. For on the day when this type of art really corresponded
to the general view of things, one of the gravest transformations of humanity
would have occurred: the regressive development of the human mind would
have begun and the end would be scarcely conceivable.Once we pass the development of our cultural life in the last
twenty-five years in review from this standpoint, we shall be horrified
to see how far we are already engaged in this regression. Everywhere we
encounter seeds which represent the beginnings of parasitic growths which
must sooner or later be the ruin of our culture. In them, too, we can recognize
the symptoms of decay of a slowly rotting world. Woe to the peoples who
can no longer master this disease!Such diseases could be seen in Germany in nearly every field
of art and culture. Everything seemed to have passed the high point and
to be hastening toward the abyss. The theater was sinking manifestly lower
and even then would have disappeared completely as a cultural factor if
the Court Theaters at least had not turned against the prostitution of art.
If we disregard them and a few other praiseworthy examples, the offerings
of the stage were of such a nature that it would have been more profitable
for the nation to keep away from them entirely. It was a sad sign of inner
decay that the youth could no longer be sent into most of these so-called
' abodes of art '-a fact which was admitted with shameless frankness by
a general display of the penny-arcade warning: 'Young people are not admitted!'Bear in mind that such precautionary measures had to be taken
in the places which should have existed primarily for the education of the
youth and not for the delectation of old and jaded sections of the population.
What would the great dramatists of all times have said to such a regulation,
and what, above all, to the circumstances which caused it? How Schiller
would have flared up, how Goethe would have turned away in indignation!But after all, what are Schiller, Goethe, or Shakespeare compared
to the heroes of the newer German poetic art? Old, outworn, outmoded, nay,
obsolete. For that was the characteristic thing about that period: not that
the period itself produced nothing but filth, but that in the bargain it
befouled everything that was really great in the past. This, to be sure,
is a phenomenon that can always be observed at such times. The baser and
more contemptible the products of the time and its people, the Lore it hates
the witnesses to the greater nobility and dignity of a former day. In such
times the people would best like to efface the memory of mankind's past
completely, so that by excluding every possibility of comparison they could
pass off their own trash as 'art.' Hence every new institution, the more
wretched and miserable it is, will try all the harder to extinguish the
last traces of the past time, whereas every true renascence of humanity
can start with an easy mind from the good achievements of past generations;
in fact, can often make them truly appreciated for the first time. It does
not have to fear that it will pale before the past; no, of itself it contributes
so valuable an addition to the general store of human culture that often,
in order to make this culture fully appreciated, it strives to keep alive
the memory of former achievements, thus making sure that the present will
fully understand the new gift. Only those who can give nothing valuable
to the world, but try to act as if they were going to give it God knows
what, will hate everything that was previously gives and would best like
to negate or even destroy it.The truth of this is by no means limited to the field of general
culture, but applies to politics as well. Revolutionary new movements will
hate the old forms in proportion to their own inferiority. Here, too, we
can see how eagerness to make their own trash appear to be something noteworthy
leads to blind hatred against the superior good of the past. As long, for
example, as the historical memory of Frederick the Great is not dead, Friedrich
Ebert can arouse nothing but limited amazement. The hero of Sans-Souci is
to the former Bremen saloon keeper approximately as the sun to the moon;
only when the rays of the sun die can the moon shine. Consequently, the
hatred of all new moons of humanity for the fixed stars is only too comprehensible.
In political life, such nonentities, if Fate temporarily casts power in
their lap, not only besmirch and befoul the past with untiring zeal, but
also remove themselves from general criticism by the most extreme methods.
The new German Reich's legislation for the defense of the Republic may pass
as an example of this.Therefore, if any new idea, a doctrine, a new philosophy, or
even a political or economic movement tries to deny the entire past, tries
to make it bad or worthless, for this reason alone we must be extremely
cautious and suspicious. As a rule the reason for such hatred is either
its own inferiority or even an evil intention as such. A really beneficial
renascence of humanity will always have to continue building where the last
good foundation stops. It will not have to be ashamed of using already existing
truths. For the whole of human culture, as well as man himself is only the
result of a single long development in which every generation contributed
and fitted in its stone. Thus the meaning and purpose of revolutions is
not to tear down the whole building but to remove what is bad or unsuitable
and to continue building on the sound spot that has been laid bare.Thus alone can we and may we speak of the progress of humanity.
Otherwise the world would never be redeemed from chaos, since every generation
would be entitled to reject the past and hence destroy the works of the
past as the presupposition for its own work.Thus, the saddest thing about the state of our whole culture
of the pre-War period was not only the total impotence of artistic and cultural
creative power in general, but the hatred with which the memory of the greater
past was besmirched and effaced. In nearly all fields of art, especially
in the theater and literature, we began around the turn of the century to
produce less that was new and significant, but to disparage the best of
the old work and represent it as inferior and surpassed; as though this
epoch of the most humiliating inferiority could surpass anything at all.
And from this effort to remove the past from the eyes of the present, the
evil intent of the apostles of the future could clearly and distinctly be
seen. By this it should have been recognized that these were no new, even
if false, cultural conceptions, but a process of destroying all culture,
paving the way for a stultification of healthy artistic feeling: the spiritual
preparation of political Bolshevism. For if the age of Pericles seems embodied
in the Parthenon, the Bolshevistic present is embodied in a cubist
monstrosity.In this connection we must also point to the cowardice which
here again was manifest in the section of our people which on the basis
of its education and position should have been obligated to resist this
cultural disgrace. But from pure fear of the clamor raised by the apostles
of Bolshevistic art, who furiously attacked anyone who didn't want to recognize
the crown of creation in them and pilloried him as a backward philistine,
they renounced all serious resistance and reconciled themselves to what
seemed after all inevitable. They were positively scared stiff that these
half-wits or scoundrels would accuse them of lack of understanding; as though
it were a disgrace not to understand the products of spiritual degenerates
or slimy swindlers. These cultural disciples, it is true, possessed a very
simple means of passing off their nonsense as something God knows how important:
they passed off all sorts of incomprehensible and obviously crazy stuff
on their amazed fellow men as a so-called inner experience, a cheap way
of taking any word of opposition out of the mouths of most people in advance.
For beyond a doubt this could be an inner experience; the doubtful part
was whether it is permissible to dish up the hallucinations of lunatics
or criminals to the healthy world. The works of a Moritz von Schwind, or
of a Bocklin, were also an inner experience, but of artists graced by God
and not of clowns.Here was a good occasion to study the pitiful cowardice of our
so-called intelligentsia, which dodged any serious resistance to this poisoning
of the healthy instinct of our people and left it to the people themselves
to deal with this insolent nonsense. In order not to be considered lacking
in artistic understanding, people stood for every mockery of art and ended
up by becoming really uncertain in the judgment of good and bad.All in all, these were tokens of times that were getting very bad.As another disquieting attribute, the following must yet
be stated:In the nineteenth century our cities began more and more to
lose the character of cultural sites and to descend to the level of mere
human settlements. The small attachment of our present big-city proletariat
for the town they live in is the consequence of the fact that it is only
the individual's accidental local stopping place, and nothing more. This
is partly connected with the frequent change of residence caused by social
conditions, which do not give a man time to form a closer bond with the
city, and another cause is to be found in the general cultural insignificance
and poverty of our present-day cities per se.At the time of the wars of liberations the German cities were
not only small in number, but also modest as to size. The few really big
cities were mostly princely residences, and as such nearly always possessed
a certain cultural value and for the most part also a certain artistic picture.
The few places with more than fifty thousand inhabitants were, compared
to present-day cities with the same population, rich in scientific and artistic
treasures When Munich numbered sixty thousand souls, it was already on its
way to becoming one of the first German art centers; today nearly every
factory town has reached this number, if not many times surpassed it, yet
some cannot lay claim to the slightest real values. Masses of apartments
and tenements, and nothing more How, in view of such emptiness, any special
bond could be expected to arise with such a town must remain a mystery.
No one will be particularly attached to a city which has nothing more to
offer than every other, which lacks every individual note and in which everything
has been carefully avoided which might even look like art or anything of
the sort.But, as if this were not enough, even the really big cities
grow relatively poorer in real art treasures with the mounting increase
in the population. They seem more and more standardized and give entirely
the same picture as the poor little factory towns, though in larger dimensions.
What recent times have added to the cultural content of our big cities is
totally inadequate. All our cities are living on the fame and treasures
of the past. For instance, take from present-day Munich everything that
was created under Ludwig I,l and you will note with horror how poor the
addition of significant artistic creations has been since that time. The
same is true of Berlin and most other big cities.The essential point, however, is the following: our big cities
of today possess no monuments dominating the city picture, which might somehow
be regarded as the symbols of the whole epoch. This was true in the cities
of antiquity, since nearly every one possessed a special monument in which
it took pride. The characteristic aspect of the ancient city did not lie
in private buildings, but in the community monuments which seemed made,
not for the moment, but for eternity, because they were intended to reflect,
not the wealth of an individual owner, but the greatness and wealth of the
community. Thus arose monuments which were very well suited to unite the
individual inhabitant with his city in a way which today sometimes seems
almost incomprehensible to us. For what the ancient had before his eyes
was less the humble houses of private owners than the magnificent edifices
of the whole community. Compared to them the dwelling house really sank
to the level of an insignificant object of secondary importance.Only if we compare the dimensions of the ancient state structures
with contemporary dwelling houses can we understand the overpowering sweep
and force of this emphasis on the principle of giving first place to public
works. The few still towering colossuses which we admire in the ruins and
wreckage of the ancient world are not former business palaces, but temples
and state structures; in other words, works whose owner was the community.
Even in the splendor of late Rome the first place was not taken by the villas
and palaces of Individual citizens, but by the temples and baths, the stadiums,
circuses, aqueducts, basilicas, etc., of the state, hence of the whole people.Even the Germanic Middle Ages upheld the same guiding principle,
though amid totally different conceptions of art. What in antiquity found
its expression in the Acropolis or the Pantheon now cloaked itself in the
forms of the Gothic Cathedral. Like giants these monumental structures towered
over the swarming frames wooden, and brick buildings of the medieval city,
and thus became symbols which even today, with the tenements climbing higher
and higher beside them, determine the character and picture of these towns.
Cathedrals, town halls, grain markets, and battlements are the visible signs
of a Inception which in the last analysis was the same as that of antiquity.Yet how truly deplorable the relation between state buildings
and private buildings has become today! If the fate of Rome should strike
Berlin, future generations would some day admire the department stores of
a few Jews as the mightiest works of our era and the hotels of a few corporations
as the characteristic expression of the culture of our times. Just compare
the miserable discrepancy prevailing in a city like even Berlin between
the structures of the Reich and those of finance and commerceEven the sum of money spent on state buildings is usually laughable
and inadequate. Works are not built for eternity, but at most for the need
of the moment. And in them there is no dominant higher idea. At the time
of its construction, the Berlin Schloss was a work of different stature
than the new library, for instance, in the setting of the present time.
While a single battleship represented a value of approximately sixty millions,
hardly half of this sum was approved for the first magnificent building
of the Reich, intended to stand for eternity, the Reichstag Building. Indeed,
when the question of interior furnishings came up for decision, the exalted
house voted against the use of stone and ordered the walls trimmed with
plaster; this time, I must admit, the parliamentarians did right for a change:
stone walls are no place for plaster heads.Thus, our cities of the present lack the outstanding symbol
of national community which, we must therefore not be surprised to find,
sees no symbol of itself in the cities. The inevitable result is a desolation
whose practical effect is the total indifference of the big-city dweller
to the destiny of his city.This, too, is a sign of our declining culture and our general
collapse. The epoch is stifling in the pettiest utilitarianism or better
expressed in the service of money. And we have no call for surprise if under
such a deity little sense of heroism remains. The present time is only harvesting
what the immediate past has sown.All these symptoms of decay are in the last analysis only the consequences
of the absence of a definite, uniformly acknowledged philosophy and she
resultant general uncertainty in the judgment and attitude toward the various
great problems of the time. That is why, beginning in education, everyone
is half-hearted and vacillating, shunning responsibility and thus ending
in cowardly tolerance of even recognized abuses. Humanitarian bilge becomes
stylish and, by weakly yielding to cankers and sparing individuals, the
future of millions is sacrificed.How widespread the general disunity was growing is shown by
an examination of religious conditions before the War. Here, too, a unified
and effective philosophical conviction had long since been lost in large
sections of the nation. In this the members officially breaking away from
the churches play a less important role than those who are completely indifferent.
While both denominations maintain missions in Asia and Africa in order to
win new followers for their doctrine-an activity which can boast but very
modest success compared to the advance of the Mohammedan faith in particular
right here in Europe they lose millions and millions of inward adherents
who either are alien to all religious life or simply go their own ways.
The consequences, particularly from the moral point of view, are not favorable.Also noteworthy is the increasingly violent struggle against
the dogmatic foundations of the various churches without which in this human
world the practical existence of a religious faith is not conceivable. The
great masses of people do not consist of philosophers; precisely for the
masses, faith is often the sole foundation of a moral attitude. The various
substitutes have not proved so successful from the standpoint of results
that they could be regarded as a useful replacement for previous religious
creeds. But if religious doctrine and faith are really to embrace the broad
masses, the unconditional authority of the content of this faith is the
foundation of all efficacy. What the current mores, without which assuredly
hundreds of thousands of well-bred people would live sensibly and reasonably
but millions of others would not, are for general living, state principles
are for the state, and dogmas for the current religion. Only through them
is the wavering and infinitely interpretable, purely intellectual idea delimited
and brought into a form without which it could never become faith. Otherwise
the idea would never pass beyond a metaphysical conception; in short, a
philosophical opinion. The attack against dogmas as such, therefore, strongly
resembles the struggle against the general legal foundations of a state,
and, as the latter would end in a total anarchy of the state, the former
would end in a worthless religious nihilism.For the political man, the value of a religion must be estimated
less by its deficiencies than by the virtue of a visibly better substitute.
As long as this appears to be lacking, what is present can be demolished
only by fools or criminals.Not the smallest blame for the none too delectable religious
conditions must be borne by those who encumber the religious idea with too
many things of a purely earthly nature and thus often bring it into a totally
unnecessary conflict with so-called exact science. In this victory will
almost always fall to the latter, though perhaps after a hard struggle,
and religion will suffer serious damage in the eyes of all those who are
unable to raise themselves above a purely superficial knowledge.Worst of all, however, is the devastation wrought by the misuse
of religious conviction for political ends. In truth, we cannot sharply
enough attack those wretched crooks who would like to make religion an implement
to perform political or rather business services for them. These insolent
liars, it is true, proclaim their creed in a stentorian voice to the whole
world for other sinners to hear; but their intention is not, if necessary,
to die for it, but to live better. For a single-political swindle, provided
it brings in enough, they are willing to sell the heart of a whole religion;
for ten parliamentary mandates they would ally themselves with the Marxistic
mortal enemies of all religions-and for a minister's chair they would even
enter into marriage with the devil, unless the devil were deterred by a
remnant of decency.If in Germany before the War religious life for many had an
unpleasant aftertaste, this could be attributed to the abuse of Christianity
on the-part of a so-called ' Christian ' party and the shameless way in
which they attempted to identify the Catholic faith with a political party.This false association was a calamity which may have brought
parliamentary mandates to a number of good-for-nothings but injury to the
Church.The consequence, however, had to be borne by the whole nation,
since the outcome of the resultant slackening of religious life occurred
at a time when everyone was beginning to waver and vacillate anyway, and
the traditional foundations of ethics and morality were threatening to collapse.This, too, created cracks and rifts in our nation which might
present no danger as long as no special strain-arose, but which inevitably
became catastrophic when by the force of great events the question of the
inner solidity of the nation achieved decisive importance.Likewise in the field of politics the observant eye could
discern evils which, if not remedied or altered within a reasonable time,
could be and had to be regarded as signs of the Reich's coming decay. The
aimlessness of German domestic and foreign policy was apparent to everyone
who was not purposely blind. The regime of compromise seemed to be most
in keeping with Bismarck's conception that 'politics is an art of the possible.'
But between Bismarck and the later German chancellors there was a slight
difference which made it permissible for the former to let fall such an
utterance on the nature of politics while the same view from the mouths
of his successors could not but take on an entirely different meaning. For
Bismarck with this phrase only wanted to say that for the achievement of
a definite political goal all possibilities should be utilized, or, in other
words, that all possibilities should be taken into account; in the view
of his successors, however, this utterance solemnly released them from the
necessity of having any political ideas or goals whatever. And the leadership
of the Reich at this time really had no more political goals; for the necessary
foundation of a definite philosophy was lacking, as well as the necessary
clarity on the inner laws governing the development of all political life.There were not a few who saw things blackly in this respect
and flayed the planlessness and heedlessness of the Reich's policies, and
well recognized their inner weakness and hollowness but these were only
outsiders in political life; the official government authorities passed
by the observations of a Houston Stewart Chamberlain with the same indifference
as still occurs today. These people are too stupid to think any-thing for
themselves and too conceited to learn what is necessary from others-an age-old
truth which caused Oxenstierna to cry out: 'The world is governed by a mere
fraction of wisdom';l and indeed nearly every ministerial secretary embodies
only an atom of this fraction. Only since Germany has become a republic,
this no longer applies. That is why it has been forbidden by the Law for
the Defense of the Republic 2 to believe, let alone discuss, any such thought.
Oxenstierna was lucky to live when he did, and not in this wise republic
of ours.Even in the pre-War period that institution which was supposed
to embody the strength of the Reich was recognized by many as its greatest
weakness: the parliament or Reichstag. Cowardice and irresponsibility were
here completely wedded.
One of the foolish remarks which today we not infrequently hear is that
parliamentarism in Germany has 'gone wrong since the revolution.' This too
easily gives the impression that it was different before the revolution.
In reality the effect of this institution can be nothing else than devastating-and
this was true even in those days when most people wore blinders and saw
nothing and wanted to see nothing. For if Germany was crushed, it was owing
not least to this institution; no thanks are owing to the Reichstag that
the catastrophe did not occur earlier; this must be attributed to the resistance
to the activity of this gravedigger of the German nation and the German
Reich, which persisted in the years of peace.Out of the vast number of devastating evils for which this institution
was directly or indirectly responsible, I shall pick only a single one which
is most in keeping with the inner essence of this most irresponsible institution
of all times: the terrible halfheartedness and weakness of the political
leaders of the Reich both at home and abroad, which, primarily attributable
to the activities of the Reichstag, developed into one of the chief reasons
for the political collapse.Half-hearted was everything that was subject in any way to the
influence of this parliament, regardless which way you look.Half-hearted and weak was the alliance policy of the Reich in
its foreign relations. By trying to preserve peace it steered inevitably
toward war.Half-hearted was the Polish policy. It consisted in irritating
without ever seriously going through with anything. The result was neither
a victory for the Germans nor conciliation of the Poles, but hostility with
Russia instead.Half-hearted was the solution of the Alsace-Lorraine question.
Instead of crushing the head of the French hydra once and for all with a
brutal fist, and then granting the Alsatian equal rights, neither of the
two was done. Nor could it be, for in the ranks of the biggest parties sat
the biggest traitors-in the Center, for example, Herr Wetterle.All this, however, would have been bearable if the general halfheartedness
had not taken possession of that power on whose existence the survival of
the Reich ultimately depended: the army.The sins of the so-called 'German Reichstag' would alone suffice
to cover it for all times with the curse of the German nation. For the most
miserable reasons, these parliamentary rabble stole and struck from the
hand of the nation its weapon of self-preservation, the only defense of
our people's freedom and independence. If today the graves of Flanders field
were to open, from them would arise the bloody accusers, hundreds of thousands
of the best young Germans who, due to the unscrupulousness of these parliamentarian
criminals, were driven, poorly trained and half-trained, into the arms of
death; the fatherland lost them and millions of crippled and dead, solely
and alone so that a few hundred misleaders of the people could perpetrate
their political swindles and blackmail, or merely rattle off their doctrinaire
theories.While the Jews in their Marxist and democratic press proclaimed
to the whole world the lie about 'German militarism' and sought to incriminate
Germany by all means, the Marxist and democratic parties were obstructing
any comprehensive training of the German national man-power. The enormous
crime that was thus committed could not help but be clear to everyone who
just considered that, in case of a coming war, the entire nation would have
to take up arms, and that, therefore, through the rascality of these savory
representatives of their own so-called 'popular representation,' millions
of Germans were driven to face the enemy half-trained and badly trained.
But even if the consequences resulting from the brutal and savage unscrupulousness
of these parliamentary pimps were left entirely out of consideration: this
lack of trained soldiers at the beginning of the War could easily lead to
its loss, and this was most terribly confirmed in the great World War.The loss of the fight for the freedom and independence of the
German nation is the result of the half-heartedness and weakness manifested
even in peacetime as regards drafting the entire national man-power for
the defense of the fatherland.If too few recruits were trained on the land, the same halfheartedness
was at work on the sea, making the weapon of national self-preservation
more or less worthless. Unfortunately the navy leadership was itself infected
with the spirit of halfheartedness. The tendency to build all ships a little
smaller than the English ships which were being launched at the same time
was hardly farsighted, much less brilliant. Especially a fleet which from
the beginning can in point of pure numbers not be brought to the same level
as its presumable adversary must seek to compensate for the lack of numbers
by the superior fighting power of its individual ships. It is the superior
fighting power which matters and not any legendary superiority in 'quality.'
Actually modern technology is so far advanced and has achieved so much uniformity
in the various civilized countries that it must be held impossible to give
the ships of one power an appreciably larger combat value than the ships
of like tonnage of another state. And it is even less conceivable to achieve
a superiority with smaller deplacement as compared to larger.In actual fact, the smaller tonnage of the German ships was
possible only at the cost of speed and armament. The phrase with which people
attempted to justify this fact showed a very serious lack of logic in the
department responsible for this in peacetime. They declared, for instance,
that the material of the German guns was so obviously superior to the British
that the German 28-centimeter gun was not behind the British 30.5centimeter
gun in performance!!But for this very reason it would have been our duty to change
over to the 30.5-centimeter gun, for the goal should have been the achievement,
not of equal but of superior fighting power. Otherwise it would have been
superfluous for the army to order the 42-centimeter mortar, since the German
21-centimeter mortar was in itself superior to any then existing high trajectory
French cannon, and the fortresses would have likewise fallen to the 30.5-centimeter
mortar. The leadership of the land army, however, thought soundly, while
that of the navy unfortunately did not.The neglect of superior artillery power and superior speed lay
entirely in. the absolutely erroneous so-called 'idea of risk.' The navy
leadership by the very form in which it expanded the fleet renounced attack
and thus from the outset inevitably assumed the defensive. But in this they
also renounced the ultimate success which is and can only be forever in
attack.A ship of smaller speed and weaker armament will as a rule be
sent to the bottom by a speedier and more heavily armed enemy at the firing
distance favorable for the latter. A number of our cruisers were to find
this out to their bitter grief. The utter mistakenness of the peacetime
opinion of the navy staff was shown by the War, which forced the introduction,
whenever possible, of modified armament in old ships and better armament
in newer ones. If in the battle of Skagerrak the German ships had had the
tonnage, the armament, the same speed as the English ships, the British
navy would have found a watery grave beneath the hurricane of the more accurate
and more effective German 38-centimeter shells.Japan carried on a different naval policy in those days. There,
on principle, the entire emphasis was laid on giving every single new ship
superior fighting power over the presumable adversary. The result was a
greater possibility of offensive utilization of the navy.While the staff of the land army still kept free of such basically
false trains of thought, the navy, which unfortunately had better 'parliamentary'
representation, succumbed to the spirit of parliament. It was organized
on the basis of half-baked ideas and was later used in a similar way. What
immortal fame the navy nevertheless achieved could only be set to the account
of the skill of the German armaments worker and the ability and incomparable
heroism of the individual officers and crews. If the previous naval high
command had shown corresponding intelligence, these sacrifices would not
have been in vain.Thus perhaps it was precisely the superior parliamentary dexterity
of the navy's peacetime head that resulted in its misfortune, since, even
in its building, parliamentary instead of purely military criteria unfortunately
began to play the decisive role. The half-heartedness and weakness as well
as the meager logic in thinking, characteristic of the parliamentary institution,
began to color the leadership of the navy.The land army, as already emphasized, still refrained from such
basically false trains of thought. Particularly the colonel in the great
General Staff of that time, Ludendorff, carried on a desperate struggle
against the criminal half-heartedness and weakness with which the Reichstag
approached the vital problems of the nation, and for the most part negated
them. If the struggle which this officer then carried on was nevertheless
in vain, the blame was borne half by parliament and half by the attitude
and weakness even more miserable, if possible- of Reich Chancellor Bethmann
Hollweg. Yet today this does not in the least prevent those who were responsible
for the German collapse from putting the blame precisely on him who alone
combated this neglect of national interests-one swindle more or less is
nothing to these born crooks.Anyone who contemplates all the sacrifices which were heaped
on the nation by the criminal frivolity of these most irresponsible among
irresponsibles, who passes in review all the uselessly sacrificed dead and
maimed, as well as the boundless shame and disgrace, the immeasurable misery
which has now struck us, and knows that all this happened only to clear
the path to ministers' chairs for a gang of unscrupulous climbers and job-hunters-anyone
who contemplates all this will understand that these creatures can, believe
me, be described only by words such as ' scoundrel, ' ' villain, ' ' scum,
' and ' criminal, ' otherwise the meaning and purpose of having these expressions
in our linguistic usage would be incomprehensible. For compared to these
traitors to the nation, every pimp is a man of honor.Strangely enough, all the really seamy sides of old Germany
attracted attention only when the inner solidarity of the nation would inevitably
suffer thereby. Yes, indeed, in such cases the unpleasant truths were positively
bellowed to the broad masses, while otherwise the same people preferred
modestly to conceal many things and in part simply to deny them. This was
the case when the open discussion of a question might have led to an improvement.
At the same time, the government offices in charge knew next to nothing
of the value and nature of propaganda. The fact that by clever and persevering
use of propaganda even heaven can be represented as hell to the people,
and conversely the most wretched life as paradise, was known only to the
Jew, who acted accordingly; the German, or rather his government, hadn't
the faintest idea of this.During the War we were to suffer most gravely for all this.Along with all the evils of German life before the War here
indicated, and many more, there were also many advantages. In a fair examination,
we must even recognize that most of our weaknesses were largely shared by
other countries and peoples, and in some, indeed, we were put completely
in the shade, while they did not possess many of our own actual advantages.At the head of these advantages we can, among other things,
set the fact that, of nearly all European peoples, the German people still
made the greatest attempt to preserve the national character of its economy
and despite certain evil omens was least subject to international financial
control. A dangerous advantage, to be sure, which later became the greatest
instigator of the World War. But aside from this and many other things,
we must, from the vast number of healthy sources of national strength, pick
three institutions which in their kind were exemplary and in part unequaled.First, the state form as such and the special stamp which it
had received in modern Germany.Here we may really disregard the individual monarchs who as
men are subject to all the weaknesses which are customarily visited upon
this earth and its children; if we were not lenient in this, we would have
to despair of the present altogether, for are not the representatives of
the present regime, considered as personalities, intellectually and morally
of the most modest proportions that we can conceive of even racking our
brains for a long time? Anyone who measures the 'value' of the German revolution
by the value and stature of the personalities which it has given the German
people since November, 1919, will have to hide his head for shame before
the judgment of future generations, whose tongue it will no longer be possible
to stop by protective laws, etc., and which therefore will say what today
all of us know to be true, to wit, that brains and virtue in our modern
German leaders are inversely proportionate to their vices and the size of
their mouths.To be sure, the monarchy had grown alien to many, to the broad
masses above all. This was the consequence of the fact that the monarchs
were not always surrounded by the brightest -to put it mildly-and above
all not by the sincerest minds. Unfortunately, a number of them liked fiatterers
better than straightforward natures, and consequently it was the fiatterers
who 'instructed' them. A very grave evil at a time when many of the world's
old opinions had undergone a great change, spreading naturally to the estimation
in which many old-established traditions of the courts were held.Thus, at the turn of the century the common man in the street
could no longer find any special admiration for the princess who rode along
the front in uniform. Apparently those in authority were incapable of correctly
judging the effect of such a parade in the eyes of the people, for if they
had, such unfortunate performances would doubtless not have occurred. Moreover,
the humanitarian bilge-not always entirely sincere-that these circles went
in for repelled more than it attracted. If, for example, Princess X condescended
to taste a sample of food in a people's kitchen, in former days it might
have looked well, but now the result was the opposite. We may be justified
in assuming that Her Highness really had no idea that the food on the day
she sampled it was a little different from what it usually was; but it was
quite enough that the people knew it.Thus, what may possibly have been the best intention became
ridiculous, if not actually irritating.Stories about the monarch's proverbial frugality, his much too
early rising and his slaving away until late into the night, amid the permanent
peril of threatening undernourishment, aroused very dubious comments. People
did not ask to know what food and how much of it the monarch deigned to
consume; they did not begrudge him a 'square' meal; nor were they out to
deprive him of the sleep he needed; they were satisfied if in other things,
as a man and character, he was an honor to the name of his house and to
the nation, and if he fulfilled his duties as a ruler. Telling fairy tales
helped little, but did all the more harm.This and many similar things were mere trifles, however. What
had a worse effect on sections of the nation, that were unfortunately very
large, was the mounting conviction that people were ruled from the top no
matter what happened, and that, therefore, the individual had no need to
bother about anything. As long as the government was really good, or at
least had the best intentions, this was bearable. But woe betide if the
old government whose intentions were after all good were replaced by a new
one which was not so decent; then spineless compliance and childlike faith
were the gravest calamity that could be conceived of.But along with these and many other weaknesses, there were unquestionable
assets.For one thing, the stability of the entire state leadership,
brought about by the monarchic form of state and the removal of the highest
state posts from the welter of speculation by ambitious politicians. Furthermore,
the dignity of the institution as such and the authority which this alone
created: likewise the raising of the civil service and particularly the
army above the level of party obligations. One more advantage was the personal
embodiment of the state's summit in the monarch as a person, and the example
of responsibility which is bound to be stronger in a monarch than in the
accidental rabble of a parliamentary majority-the proverbial incorruptibility
of the German administration could primarily be attributed to this. Finally,
the cultural value of the monarchy for the German people was high and could
very well compensate for other drawbacks. The German court cities were still
the refuge of an artistic state of mind, which is increasingly threatening
to die out in our materialistic times. What the German princes did for art
and science, particularly in the nineteenth century, was exemplary. The
present period in any case cannot be compared with it.As the greatest credit factor, however, in this period of
incipient and slowly spreading decomposition of our nation, we must note
the army. It was the mightiest school of the German nation, and not for
nothing was the hatred of all our enemies directed against this buttress
of national freedom and independence. No more glorious monument can be dedicated
to this unique institution than a statement of the truth that it was slandered,
hated, combated, and also feared by all inferior peoples. The fact that
the rage of the international exploiters of our people in Versailles was
directed primarily against the old German army permits us to recognize it
as the bastion of our national freedom against the power of the stock exchange.
Without this warning power, the intentions of Versailles would long since
have been carried out against our people. What the German people owes to
the army can be briefly summed up in a single word, to wit: everything.The army trained men for unconditional responsibility at a time
when this quality had grown rare and evasion of it was becoming more and
more the order of the day, starting with the model prototype of all irresponsibility,
the parliament; it trained men in personal courage in an age when cowardice
threatened to become a raging disease and the spirit of sacrifice, the willingness
to give oneself for the general welfare, was looked on almost as stupidity,
and the only man regarded as intelligent was the one who best knew how to
indulge and advance his own ego. it was the school that still taught the
individual German not to seek the salvation of the nation in lying phrases
about an international brotherhood between Negroes, Germans, Chinese, French,
etc., but in the force and solidarity of our own nation.The army trained men in resolution while elsewhere in life indecision
and doubt were beginning to determine the actions of men. In an age when
everywhere the know-it-alls were setting the tone, it meant something to
uphold the principle that some command is always better than none. In this
sole principle there was still an unspoiled robust health which would long
since have disappeared from the rest of our life if the army and its training
had not provided a continuous renewal of this primal force. We need only
see the terrible indecision of the Reich's present leaders, who can summon
up the energy for no action unless it is the forced signing of a new decree
for plundering the people; in this case, to be sure, they reject all responsibility
and with the agility of a court stenographer sign everything that anyone
may see fit to put before them. In this case the decision is easy to take;
for it is dictated.The army trained men in idealism and devotion to the fatherland
and its greatness while everywhere else greed and materialism had spread
abroad. It educated a single people in contrast to the division into classes
and in this perhaps its sole mistake was the institution of voluntary one-year
enlistment. A mistake, because through it the principle of unconditional
equality was broken, and-the man with higher education was removed from
the setting of his general environment, while precisely the exact opposite
would have been advantageous. In view of the great unworldliness of our
upper classes and their constantly mounting estrangement from their own
people, the army could have exerted a particularly beneficial effect if
in its own ranks, at least, it had avoided any segregation of the so-called
intelligentsia. That this was not done was a mistake; but what institution
in this world makes no mistakes? In this one, at any rate, the good was
so predominant that the few weaknesses lay far beneath the average degree
of human imperfection.It must be attributed to the army of the old Reich as its highest
merit that at a time when heads were generally counted by majorities, it
placed heads above the majority. Confronted with -the Jewish-democratic
idea of a blind-worship of numbers, the army sustained belief in personality.
And thus it trained what the new epoch most urgently needed: men. In the
morass of a universally spreading softening and effeminization, each year
three hundred and fifty thousand vigorous young men sprang from the ranks
of the army, men who in their two years' training had lost the softness
of youth and achieved bodies hard as steel. The young man who practiced
obedience during this time could-then learn to command. By his very step
you could recognize the soldier who had done his service.This was--the highest school of the German nation, and it was
not for nothing that the bitterest hatred of those who from envy and-greed
needed and desired the impotence of the Reich and the defenselessness of
its citizens was concentrated on it What many Germans in their blindness
or ill will did not want to see was recognized-by the foreign world: the
German army was the mightiest weapon serving the freedom of the German nation
and the sustenance of its children.The third in the league, along with the state form and the
army, was the incomparable civil service of the old Reich.Germany was the best organized and best administered country
in the world. The German government official might well be accused of bureaucratic
red tape, but in the other countries things were no better in this respect;
they were worse. But what the other countries did not possess was the wonderful
solidity of this apparatus and the incorruptible honesty of its members.
It was better to be a little old-fashioned, but honest and loyal, than enlightened
and modern, but of inferior character and, as is often seen today, ignorant
and incompetent. For if today people like to pretend that the German administration
of the pre-War period, though bureaucratically sound, was bad from a business
point of view, only the following answer can be given: what country in the
world had an institution better directed and better organized in a business
sense than Germany's state railways? It was reserved to the revolution to
go on wrecking this exemplary apparatus until at last it seemed ripe for
being taken out of the hands of the nation and socialized according to the
lights of this Republic's founders; in other words, made to serve international
stock exchange capital, the power behind the German revolution.What especially distinguished the German civil service and administrative
apparatus was their independence from the individual governments whose passing
political views could have no effect on the job of German civil servant.
Since the revolution, it must be admitted, this has completely changed.
Ability and competence were replaced by party ties and a self-reliant, independent
character became more of a hindrance than a help.
The state form, the army. and the civil service formed the basis for the
old Reich's wonderful power and strength. These first and foremost were
the reasons for a quality which is totally lacking in the present-day state:
state's authority! For this is not based on bull-sessions in parliaments
or provincial diets, or on laws for its protection, or court sentences to
frighten those who insolently deny it, etc., but on the general confidence
which may and can be placed in the leadership and administration of a commonwealth.
This confidence, in turn, results only from an unshakable inner faith in
the selflessness and honesty of the government and administration of a country
and from an agreement between the spirit of the laws and the general ethical
view. For in the long run government systems are not maintained by the pressure
of violence, but by faith in their soundness and in the. truthfulness with
which they represent and advance the interests of a people.Gravely as certain evils of the pre-War period corroded and
threatened to undermine the inner strength of the nation, it must not be
forgotten that other states suffered even more than Germany from most of
these ailments and yet in the critical hour of danger did not nag and perish.
But if we consider that the German weaknesses before the War were balanced
by equally great strengths, the ultimate cause of the collapse can and must
lie in a different field; and this is actually the case.The deepest and ultimate reason for the decline of the old Reich
lay in its failure to recognize the racial problem and its importance for
the historical development of peoples. For events in the lives of peoples
are not expressions of chance, but processes related to the self-preservation
and propagation of the species and the race and subject to the laws of Nature,
even if people are not conscious of the inner reason for their actions.


THERE are some

truths which are so obvious that for this very reason they are not

seen or at least not recognized by ordinary people. They sometimes

pass by such truisms as though blind and are most astonished when

someone suddenly discovers what everyone really ought to know.

Columbus's eggs lie around by the hundreds of thousands, but Columbuses

are met with less frequently.Thus men without

exception wander about in the garden of Nature; they imagine that they

know practically everything and yet with few exceptions pass blindly by

one of the most patent principles of Nature's rule: the inner segregation

of the species of all living beings on this earth.Even the most superficial

observation shows that Nature's restricted
form of propagation and

increase is an almost rigid basic law of all the
innumerable forms of

expression of her vital urge. Every animal mates only
with a member of the

same species. The titmouse seeks the titmouse, the
finch the finch, the

stork the stork, the field mouse the field mouse, the
dormouse the dormouse,

the wolf the she-wolf, etc.Only unusual circumstances can change this, primarily the compulsion of captivity or any other cause that makes it impossible to mate within the same species. But then Nature begins to resist this with all possible means, and her most visible protest consists either in refusing further
capacity for propagation to bastards or in limiting the fertility of later offspring; in most cases, however, she takes away the power of resistance to disease or hostile attacks.This is only too natural.Any crossing of two beings not at exactly the same level produces
a medium between the level of the two parents. This means: the offspring will probably stand higher than the racially lower parent, but not as high as the higher one. Consequently, it will later succumb in the struggle against the higher level. Such mating is contrary to the will of Nature for a higher breeding of all life. The precondition for this does not lie in associating superior and inferior, but in the total victory of the former. The stronger must dominate and not blend with the weaker, thus sacrificing his own greatness. Only the born weakling can view this as cruel, but he after all is only a weak and limited man; for if this law did not prevail, any conceivable higher development of organic living beings would be unthinkable.The consequence of this racial purity, universally valid in
Nature, is not only the sharp outward delimitation of the various races,
but their uniform character in themselves. The fox is always a fox, the goose a goose, the tiger a tiger, etc., and the difference can lie at most in the varying measure of force, strength, intelligence, dexterity, endurance,
etc., of the individual specimens. But you will never find a fox who in
his inner attitude might, for example, show humanitarian tendencies toward
geese, as similarly there is no cat with a friendly inclination toward mice.Therefore, here, too, the struggle among themselves arises less from inner aversion than from hunger and love. In both cases, Nature looks on calmly, with satisfaction, in fact. In the struggle for daily bread all those who are weak and sickly or less determined succumb, while the struggle of the males for the female grants the right or opportunity to propagate only to the healthiest. And struggle is always a means for improving a species' health and power of resistance and, therefore, a cause of its higher development.If the process were different, all further and higher development would cease and the opposite would occur. For, since the inferior always predominates numerically over the best, if both had the same possibility of preserving life and propagating, the inferior would multiply so much more rapidly that in the end the best would inevitably be driven into the background, unless a correction of this state of affairs were undertaken. Nature does just this by subjecting the weaker part to such severe living conditions that by them alone the number is limited, and by not permitting the remainder to increase promiscuously, but making a new and ruthless choice according to strength and health.No more than Nature desires the mating of weaker with stronger individuals, even less does she desire the blending of a higher with a lower race, since, if she did, her whole work of higher breeding, over perhaps hundreds of thousands of years, night be ruined with one blow.Historical experience offers countless proofs of this. It shows with terrifying clarity that in every mingling of Aryan blood with that of lower peoples the result was the end of the cultured people. North America, whose population consists in by far the largest part of Germanic elements who mixed but little with the lower colored peoples, shows a different humanity and culture from Central and South America, where the predominantly Latin immigrants often mixed with the aborigines on a large scale. By this one example, we can clearly and distinctly recognize the effect of racial mixture. The Germanic inhabitant of the American continent, who has remained racially pure and unmixed, rose to be master of the continent; he will remain the master as long as he does not fall a victim to defilement of the blood.The result of all racial crossing is therefore in brief always the following:





 Lowering of the level of the higher race; Physical and intellectual regression and hence the beginning of a slowly but surely progressing sickness.





To bring about such a development is, then, nothing else but
to sin against the will of the eternal creator.And as a sin this act is rewarded.When man attempts to rebel against the iron logic of Nature,
he comes into struggle with the principles to which he himself owes his
existence as a man. And this attack I must lead to his own doom.Here, of course, we encounter the objection of the modern pacifist,
as truly Jewish in its effrontery as it is stupid! 'Man's role is to overcome
Nature!'Millions thoughtlessly parrot this Jewish nonsense and end up by really imagining that they themselves represent a kind of conqueror of
Nature; though in this they dispose of no other weapon than an idea, and
at that such a miserable one, that if it were true no world at all would
be conceivableBut quite aside from the fact that man has never yet conquered Nature in anything, but at most has caught hold of and tried to lift one
or another corner of her immense gigantic veil of eternal riddles and secrets,
that in reality he invents nothing but only discovers everything, that he
does not dominate Nature, but has only risen on the basis of his knowledge
of various laws and secrets of Nature to be lord over those other living
creatures who lack this knowledge-quite aside from all this, an idea cannot
overcome the preconditions for the development and being of humanity, since
the idea itself depends only on man. Without human beings there is no human
idea in this world, therefore the idea as such is always conditioned by
the presence of human beings and hence of all the laws which created the
precondition for their existence.And not only that! Certain ideas are even tied up with certain
men. This applies most of all to those ideas whose content originates, not
in an exact scientific truth, but in the world of emotion, or, as it is
so beautifully and clearly expressed today, reflects an 'inner experience.'
All these ideas, which have nothing to do with cold logic as such, but represent
only pure expressions of feeling, ethical conceptions, etc., are chained
to the existence of men, to whose intellectual imagination and creative
power they owe their existence. Precisely in this case the preservation
of these definite races and men is the precondition for the existence of
these ideas. Anyone, for example, who really desired the victory of the
pacifistic idea in this world with all his heart would have to fight with
all the means at his disposal for the conquest of the world by the Germans;
for, if the opposite should occur, the last pacifist would die out with
the last German, since the rest of the world has never fallen so deeply
as our own people, unfortunately, has for this nonsense so contrary to Nature
and reason. Then, if we were serious, whether we liked it or not, we would
have to wage wars in order to arrive at pacifism. This and nothing else
was what Wilson, the American world savior, intended, or so at least our
German visionaries believed-and thereby his purpose was fulfilled.In actual fact the pacifistic-humane idea is perfectly all right
perhaps when the highest type of man has previously conquered and subjected
the world to an extent that makes him the sole ruler of this earth. Then
this idea lacks the power of producing evil effects in exact proportion
as its practical application becomes rare and finally impossible. Therefore,
first struggle and then we shall see what can be done.l Otherwise mankind
has passed the high point of its development and the end is not the domination
of any ethical idea but barbarism and consequently chaos. At this point
someone or other may laugh, but this planet once moved through the ether
for millions of years without human beings and it can do so again some day
if men forget that they owe their higher existence, not to the ideas of
a few crazy ideologists, but to the knowledge and ruthless application of
Nature's stern and rigid laws.Everything we admire on this earth today-science and art, technology
and inventions-is only the creative product of a few peoples and originally
perhaps of one race. On them depends the existence of this whole culture.
If they perish, the beauty of this earth will sink into the grave with them.However much the soil, for example, can influence men, the result
of the influence will always be different depending on the races in question.
The low fertility of a living space may spur the one race to the highest
achievements; in others it will only be the cause of bitterest poverty and
final undernourishment with all its consequences. The inner nature of peoples
is always determining for the manner in which outward influences will be
effective. What leads the one to starvation trains the other to hard work.All great cultures of the past perished only because the originally
creative race died out from blood poisoning.The ultimate cause of such a decline was their forgetting that
all culture depends on men and not conversely; hence that to preserve a
certain culture the man who creates it must be preserved. This preservation
is bound up with the rigid law of necessity and the right to victory of
the best and stronger in this world.Those who want to live, let them fight, and those who do not
want to fight in this world of eternal struggle do not deserve to live.Even if this were hard-that is how it is ! Assuredly, however
by far the harder fate is that which strikes the man who thinks he can overcome
Nature, but in the last analysis only mocks her. Distress, misfortune, and
diseases are her answer.The man who misjudges and disregards the racial laws actually
forfeits the happiness that seems destined to be his. He thwarts the triumphal
march of the best race and hence also the precondition for all human progress,
and remains, in consequence burdened with all the sensibility of man, in
the animal realm of helpless misery.It is idle to argue which race or races were the original representative
of human culture and hence the real founders of all that we sum up under
the word 'humanity.' It is simpler to raise this question with regard to
the present, and here an easy, clear answer results. All the human culture,
all the results of art, science, and technology that we see before us today,
are almost exclusively the creative product of the Aryan. This very fact
admits of the not unfounded inference that he alone was the founder of all
higher humanity, therefore representing the prototype of all that we understand
by the word 'man.' He is the Prometheus of mankind from whose bright forehead
the divine spark of genius has sprung at all times, forever kindling anew
that fire of knowledge which illumined the night of silent mysteries and
thus caused man to climb the path to mastery over the other beings of this
earth. Exclude him-and perhaps after a few thousand years darkness will
again descend on the earth, human culture will pass, and the world turn
to a desert.If we were to divide mankind into three groups, the founders
of culture, the bearers of culture, the destroyers of culture, only the
Aryan could be considered as the representative of the first group. From
him originate the foundations and walls of all human creation, and only
the outward form and color are determined by the changing traits of character
of the various peoples. He provides the mightiest building stones and plans
for all human progress and only the execution corresponds to the nature
of the varying men and races. In a few decades, for example, the entire
east of Asia will possess a culture whose ultimate foundation will be Hellenic
spirit and Germanic technology, just as much as in Europe. Only the outward
form-in part at least-will bear the features of Asiatic character. It is
not true, as some people think, that Japan adds European technology to its
culture; no, European science and technology are trimmed with Japanese characteristics.
The foundation of actual life is no longer the special Japanese culture,
although it determines the color of life-because outwardly, in consequence
of its inner difference, it is more conspicuous to the European-but the
gigantic scientific-technical achievements of Europe and America; that is,
of Aryan peoples. Only on the basis of these achievements can the Orient
follow general human progress. They furnish the basis of the struggle for
daily bread, create weapons and implements for it, and only the outward
form is gradually adapted to Japanese character.If beginning today all further Aryan influence on Japan should
stop, assuming that Europe and America should perish, Japan's present rise
in science and technology might continue for a short time; but even in a
few years the well would dry up, the Japanese special character would gain,
but the present culture would freeze and sink back into the slumber from
which it was awakened seven decades ago by the wave of Aryan culture. Therefore,
just as the present Japanese development owes its life to Aryan origin,
long ago in the gray past foreign influence and foreign spirit awakened
the Japanese culture of that time. The best proof of this is furnished by
the fact of its subsequent sclerosis and total petrifaction. This can occur
in a people only when the original creative racial nucleus has been lost,
or if the external influence which furnished the impetus and the material
for the first development in the cultural field was later lacking. But if
it iS established that a people receives the most essential basic materials
of its culture from foreign races, that it assimilates and adapts them,
and that then, if further external influence is lacking, it rigidifies again
and again, such a race may be designated as culture-bearing,' but never
as 'culture-creating.' An examination of the various peoples from this standpoint
points to the fact that practically none of them were originally culture-founding,
but almost always culture-bearing.Approximately the following picture of their development always
results:Aryan races-often absurdly small numerically-subject foreign
peoples, and then, stimulated by the special living conditions of the new
territory (fertility, climatic conditions, etc.) and assisted by the multitude
of lower-type beings standing at their disposal as helpers, develop the
intellectual and organizational capacities dormant within them. Often in
a few millenniums or even centuries they create cultures which originally
bear all the inner characteristics of their nature, adapted to the above-indicated
special qualities of the soil and subjected beings. In the end, however,
the conquerors transgress against the principle of blood purity, to which
they had first adhered; they begin to mix with the subjugated inhabitants
and thus end their own existence; for the fall of man in paradise has always
been followed by his expulsion.After a thousand years and more, the last visible trace of the
former master people is often seen in the lighter skin color which its blood
left behind in the subjugated race, and in a petrified culture which it
had originally created. For, once the actual and spiritual conqueror lost
himself in the blood of the subjected people, the fuel for the torch of
human progress was lost! Just as, through the blood of the former masters,
the color preserved a feeble gleam in their memory, likewise the night of
cultural life is gently illumined by the remaining creations of the former
light-bringers. They shine through all the returned barbarism and too often
inspire the thoughtless observer of the moment with the opinion that he
beholds the picture of the present people before him, whereas he is only
gazing into the mirror of the past.It is then possible that such a people will a second time, or
even more often in the course of its history, come into contact with the
race of those who once brought it culture, and the memory of former encounters
will not necessarily be present. Unconsciously the remnant of the former
master blood will turn toward. the new arrival, and what was first possible
only by compulsion can now succeed through the people's own will. A new
cultural wave makes its entrance and continues until those who have brought
it are again submerged in the blood of foreign peoples.
It will be the task of a future cultural and world history to carry on researches
in this light and not to stifle in the rendition of external facts, as is
so often, unfortunately, the case with our present historical science.This mere sketch of the development of 'culture-bearing' nations
gives a picture of the growth, of the activity, and-the decline-of the true
culture-founders of this earth, the Aryans themselves.As in daily life the so-called genius requires a special cause,
indeed, often a positive impetus, to make him shine, likewise the genius-race
in the life of peoples. In the monotony of everyday life even significant
men often seem insignificant, hardly rising above the average of their environment;
as soon, however, as they are approached by a situation in which others
lose hope or go astray, the genius rises manifestly from the inconspicuous
average child, not seldom to the amazement of all those who had hitherto
seen him in the pettiness of bourgeois life-and that is why the prophet
seldom has any honor in his own country. Nowhere have we better occasion
to observe this than in war. From apparently harmless children, in difficult
hours when others lose hope, suddenly heroes shoot up with death-defying
determination and an icy cool presence of minds If this hour of trial had
not come, hardly anyone would ever have guessed that a young hero was hidden
in this beardless boy. It nearly always takes some stimulus to bring the
genius on the scene. The hammer-stroke of Fate which throws one man to the
ground suddenly strikes steel in another, and when the shell of everyday
life is broken, the previously hidden kernel lies open before the eyes of
the astonished world. The world then resists and does not want to believe
that the type which is apparently identical with it is suddenly a very different
being; a process which is repeated with every eminent son of man.Though an inventor, for example, establishes his fame only on
the day of his invention, it is a mistake to think that genius as such entered
into the man only at this hour-the spark of genius exists in the brain of
the truly creative man from the hour of his birth. True genius is always
inborn and never cultivated, let alone learned.As already emphasized, this applies not only to the individual
man but also to the race. Creatively active peoples always have a fundamental
creative gift, even if it should not be recognizable to the eyes of superficial
observers. Here, too, outward recognition is possible only in consequence
of accomplished deeds, since the rest of the world is not capable of recognizing
genius in itself, but sees only its visible manifestations in the form of
inventions, discoveries, buildings, pictures, etc.; here again it often
takes a long time before the world can fight its way through to this knowledge.
Just as in the life of the outstanding individual, genius or extraordinary
ability strives for practical realization only when spurred on by special
occasions, likewise in the life of nations the creative forces and capacities
which are present can often be exploited only when definite preconditions
invite.We see this most distinctly in connection with the race which
has been and is the bearer of human cultural development-the Aryans. As
soon as Fate leads them toward special conditions, their latent abilities
begin to develop in a more and more rapid sequence and to mold themselves
into tangible forms. The cultures which they found in such cases are nearly
always decisively determined by the existing soil, the given climate, and-the
subjected people. This last item, to be sure, is almost the most decisive.
The more primitive the technical foundations for a cultural activity, the
more necessary is the presence of human helpers who, organizationally assembled
and employed, must replace the force of the machine. Without this possibility
of using lower human beings, the Aryan would never have been able to take
his first steps toward his future culture; just as without the help of various
suitable beasts which he knew how to tame, he would not have arrived at
a technology which is now gradually permitting him to do without these beasts.
The saying, 'The Moor has worked off his debt, the Moor can go,' unfortunately
has only too deep a meaning. For thousands of years the horse had to serve
man and help him lay the foundations of a development which now, in consequence
of the motor car, is making the horse superfluous. In a few years his activity
trill have ceased, but without his previous collaboration man might have
had a hard time getting where he is today.Thus, for the formation of higher cultures the existence of
lower human types was one of the most essential preconditions, since they
alone were able to compensate for the lack of technical aids without which
a higher development is not conceivable. It is certain that the first culture
of humanity was based less on the tamed animal than on the use of lower
human beings.Only after the enslavement of subjected races did the same fate
strike beasts, and not the other way around, as some people would like to
think. For first the conquered warrior drew the plow-and only after him
the horse. Only pacifistic fools can regard this as a sign of human depravity,
failing to realize that this development had to take place in order to reach
the point where today these sky-pilots could force their drivel on the world.The progress of humanity is like climbing an endless ladder;
it is impossible to climb higher without first taking the lower steps. Thus,
the Aryan had to take the road to which reality directed him and not the
one that would appeal to the imagination of a modern pacifist. The road
of reality is hard and difficult, but in the end it leads where our friend
would like to bring humanity by dreaming, but unfortunately removes more
than bringing itHence it is no accident that the first cultures arose in places
where the Aryan, in his encounters with lower peoples, subjugated them and
bent them to his will. They then became the first technical instrument in
the service of a developing culture.Thus, the road which the Aryan had to take was clearly marked
out As a conqueror he subjected the lower beings and regulated their practical
activity under his command, according to his will and for his aims. But
in directing them to a useful, though arduous activity, he not only spared
the life of those he subjected; perhaps he gave them a fate that was better
than their previous so-called 'freedom.' As long as he ruthlessly upheld
the master attitude, not only did he really remain master, but also the
preserver and increaser of culture. For culture was based exclusively on
his abilities and hence on his actual survival. As soon as the subjected
people began to raise themselves up and probably approached the conqueror
in language, the sharp dividing wall between master and servant fell. The
Aryan gave up the purity of his blood and, therefore, lost his sojourn in
the paradise which he had made for himself. He became submerged in the racial
mixture, and gradually, more and more, lost his cultural capacity, until
at last, not only mentally but also physically, he began to resemble the
subjected aborigines more than his own ancestors. For a time he could live
on the existing cultural benefits, but then petrifaction set in and he fell
a prey to oblivion.Thus cultures and empires collapsed to make place for new formations.Blood mixture and the resultant drop in the racial level is
the sole cause of the dying out of old cultures; for men do not perish as
a result of lost wars, but by the loss of that force of resistance which
is contained only in pure blood.All who are not of good race in this world are chaff.And all occurrences in world history are only the expression
of the races' instinct of self-preservation, in the good or bad sense.The question of the inner causes of the Aryan's importance can
be answered to the effect that they are to be sought less in a natural instinct
of self-preservation than in the special type of its expression. The will
to live, subjectively viewed, is everywhere equal and different only in
the form of its actual expression. In the most primitive living creatures
the instinct of self-preservation does not go beyond concern for their own
ego. Egoism, as we designate this urge, goes so far that it even embraces
time; the moment itself claims everything, granting nothing to the coming
hours. In this condition the animal lives only for himself, seeks food only
for his present hunger, and fights only for his own life. As long as the
instinct of self-preservation expresses itself in this way, every basis
is lacking for the formation of a group, even the most primitive form of
family. Even a community between male and female beyond pure mating, demands
an extension of the instinct of self-preservation, since concern and struggle
for the ego are now directed toward the second party; the male sometimes
seeks food for the female, too, but for the most part both seek nourishment
for the young. Nearly always one comes to the defense of the other, and
thus the first, though infinitely simple, forms of a sense of sacrifice
result. As soon as this sense extends beyond the narrow limits of the family,
the basis for the formation of larger organisms and finally formal states
is created.In the lowest peoples of the earth this quality is present only
to a very slight extent, so that often they do not go beyond the formation
of the family. The greater the readiness to subordinate purely personal
interests, the higher rises the ability to establish comprehensive communities.This self-sacrificing will to give one's personal labor and
if necessary one's own life for others is most strongly developed in the
Aryan. The Aryan is not greatest in his mental qualities as such, but in
the extent of his willingness to put all his abilities in the service of
the community. In him the instinct of self-preservation has reached the
noblest form, since he willingly subordinates his own ego to-the life of
the community and, if the hour demands, even sacrifices it.Not in his intellectual gifts lies the source of the Aryan's
capacity for creating and building culture. If he had just this alone, he
could only act destructively, in no case could he organize; for the innermost
essence of all organization requires that the individual renounce putting
forward his personal opinion and interests and sacrifice both in favor of
a larger group. Only byway of this general community does he again recover
his share. Now, for example, he no longer works directly for himself, but
with his activity articulates himself with the community, not only for his
own advantage, but for the advantage of all. The most wonderful elucidation
of this attitude is provided by his word 'work,' by which he does not mean
an activity for maintaining life in itself, but exclusively a creative effort
that does not conflict with the interests of the community. Otherwise he
designates human activity, in so far as it serves the instinct of self-preservation
without consideration for his fellow men, as theft, usury, robbery, burglary,
etc.This state of mind, which subordinates the interests of the
ego to the conservation of the community, is really the first premise for
every truly human culture. From it alone can arise all the great works of
mankind, which bring the founder little reward, but the richest blessings
to posterity. Yes from it alone can we understand how so many are able to
bear up faithfully under a scanty life which imposes on them nothing but
poverty and frugality, but gives the community the foundations of its existence.
Every worker, every peasant, every inventor, official, etc., who works without
ever being able to achieve any happiness or prosperity for himself, is a
representative of this lofty idea, even if the deeper meaning of his activity
remains hidden in him.What applies to work as the foundation of human sustenance and
all human progress is true to an even greater degree for the defense of
man and his culture. In giving one's own life for the existence of the community
lies the crown of all sense of sacrifice. It is this alone that prevents
what human hands have built from being overthrown by human hands or destroyed
bat Nature. Our own German language possesses a word which magnificently
designates this kind of activity: Pflichterfullung (fulfillment of duty);
it means not to be self-sufficient but to serve the community.The basic attitude from which such activity arises, we call-to
distinguish it from egoism and selfishness-idealism. By this we understand
only the individual's capacity to make sacrifices for the community, for
his fellow men.How necessary it is to keep realizing that idealism does not
represent a superfluous expression of emotion, but that in truth it has
been, is, and will be, the premise for what we designate as human culture,
yes, that it alone created the concept of 'man' It is to this inner attitude
that the Aryan owes his position in this world, and to it the world owes
man; for it alone formed from pure spirit the creative force which, by a
unique pairing of the brutal fist and the intellectual genius, created the
monuments of human culture.Without his idealistic attitude all, even the most dazzling
faculties of the intellect, would remain mere intellect as such
outward appearance without inner value, and never creative force.But, since true idealism is nothing but the subordination of
the interests and life of the individual to the community, and this in turn
is the precondition for the creation of organizational forms of all kinds,
it corresponds in its innermost depths to the ultimate will of Nature. It
alone leads men to voluntary recognition of the privilege of force and strength,
and thus makes them into a dust particle of that order which shapes and
forms the whole universe.The purest idealism is unconsciously equivalent to the deepest
knowledge.How correct this is, and how little true idealism has to do
with playful flights of the imagination, can be seen at once if we let the
unspoiled child, a healthy boy, for example, judge. The same boy who feels
like throwing up I when he hears the tirades of a pacifist 'idealist' is
ready to give his young life for the ideal of his nationality.Here the instinct of knowledge unconsciously obeys the deeper
necessity of the preservation of the species, if necessary at the cost of
the individual, and protests against the visions of the pacifist windbag
who in reality is nothing but a cowardly, though camouflaged, egoist, transgressing
the laws of development; for development requires willingness on the part
of the individual to sacrifice himself for the community, and not the sickly
imaginings of cowardly know-it-alls and critics of Nature.Especially, therefore, at times when the ideal attitude threatens
to disappear, we can at once recognize a diminution of that force which
forms the community and thus creates the premises of culture. As soon as
egoism becomes the ruler of a people, the bands of order are loosened and
in the chase after their own happiness men fall from heaven into a real
hell.Yes, even posterity forgets the men who have only served their
own advantage and praises the heroes who have renounced their own happiness.The mightiest counterpart to the Aryan is represented by the
Jew. In hardly any people in the world is the instinct of self-preservation
developed more strongly than in the so-called 'chosen.' Of this, the mere
fact of the survival of this race may be considered the best proof. Where
is the people which in the last two thousand years has been exposed to so
slight changes of inner disposition, character, etc., as the Jewish people?
What people, finally, has gone through greater upheavals than this one-and
nevertheless issued from the mightiest catastrophes of mankind unchanged?
What an infinitely tough will to live and preserve the species speaks from
these facts !The mental qualities of the Jew have been schooled in the course
of many centuries. Today he passes as 'smart,' and this in a certain sense
he has been at all times. But his intelligence is not the result of his
own development, but of visual instruction through foreigners. For the human
mind cannot climb to the top without steps; for every step upward he needs
the foundation of the past, and this in the comprehensive sense in which
it can be revealed only in general culture. All thinking is based only in
small part on man's own knowledge, and mostly on the experience of the -time
that has preceded. The general cultural level provides the individual man,
without his noticing it as a rule, with such a profusion of preliminary
knowledge that, thus armed, he can more easily take further steps of his
own. The boy of today, for example, grows up among a truly vast number of
technical acquisitions of the last centuries, so that he takes for granted
and no longer pays attention to much that a hundred years ago was a riddle
to even the greatest minds, although for following and understanding our
progress in the field in question it is of decisive importance to him. If
a very genius from the twenties of the past century should suddenly leave
his grave today, it would be harder for him even intellectually to find
his way in the present era than for an average boy of fifteen today. For
he would lack all the infinite preliminary education which our present contemporary
unconsciously, so to speak, assimilates while growing up amidst the manifestations
of our present general civilization.Since the Jew-for reasons which will at once become apparent-was
never in possession of a culture of his own, the foundations of his intellectual
work were always provided by others. His intellect at all times developed
through the cultural world surrounding him.The reverse process never took place.For if the Jewish people's instinct of self-preservation is
not smaller but larger than that of other peoples, if his intellectual faculties
can easily arouse the impression that they are equal to the intellectual
gifts of other races, he lacks completely the most essential requirement
for a cultured people, the idealistic attitude.In the Jewish people the will to self-sacrifice does not go
beyond the individual's naked instinct of self-preservation. Their apparently
great sense of solidarity is based on the very primitive herd instinct that
is seen in many other living creatures in this world. It is a noteworthy
fact that the herd instinct leads to mutual support only as long as a common
danger makes this seem useful or inevitable. The same pack of wolves which
has just fallen on its prey together disintegrates when hunger abates into
its individual beasts. The same is true of horses which try to defend themselves
against an assailant in a body, but scatter again as soon as the danger
is past.It is similar with the Jew. His sense of sacrifice is only apparent.
It exists only as long as the existence of the individual makes it absolutely
necessary. However, as soon as the common enemy is conquered, the danger
threatening all averted and the booty hidden, the apparent harmony of the Jews among themselves ceases, again making way for their old causal tendencies. The Jew is only united when a common danger forces him to be or a common
booty entices him; if these two grounds are lacking, the qualities of the
crassest egoism come into their own, and in the twinkling of an eye the
united people turns into a horde of rats, fighting bloodily among themselves.If the Jews were alone in this world, they would stifle in filth
and offal; they would try to get ahead of one another in hate-filled struggle
and exterminate one another, in so far as the absolute absence of all sense
of self-sacrifice, expressing itself in their cowardice, did not turn battle
into comedy here too.So it is absolutely wrong to infer any ideal sense of sacrifice
in the Jews from the fact that they stand together in struggle, or, better
expressed, in the plundering of their fellow men.Here again the Jew is led by nothing but the naked egoism of
the individual.That is why the Jewish state-which should be the living organism
for preserving and increasing a race-is completely unlimited as to territory.
For a state formation to have a definite spatial setting always presupposes
an idealistic attitude on the part of the state-race, and especially a correct
interpretation of the concept of work. In the exact measure in which this
attitude is lacking, any attempt at forming, even of preserving, a spatially
delimited state fails. And thus the basis on which alone culture can arise
is lacking.Hence the Jewish people, despite all apparent intellectual qualities,
is without any true culture, and especially without any culture of its own.
For what sham culture the Jew today possesses is the property of other peoples,
and for the most part it is ruined in his hands.In judging the Jewish people's attitude on the question of human
culture, the most essential characteristic we must always bear in mind is
that there has never been a Jewish art and accordingly there is none today
either; that above all the two queens of all the arts, architecture and
music, owe nothing original to the Jews. What they do accomplish in the
field of art is either patchwork or intellectual theft. Thus, the Jew lacks
those qualities which distinguish the races that are creative and hence
culturally blessed.To what an extent the Jew takes over foreign culture, imitating
or rather ruining it, can be seen from the fact that he is mostly found
in the art which seems to require least original invention, the art of acting.
But even here, in reality, he is only a ' juggler,' or rather an ape; for
even here he lacks the last touch that is required for real greatness; even
here he is not the creative genius, but a superficial imitator, and all
the twists and tricks that he uses are powerless to conceal the inner lifelessness
of his creative gift. Here the Jewish press most lovingly helps him along
by raising such a roar of hosannahs about even the most mediocre bungler,
just so long as he is a Jew, that the rest of the world actually ends up
by thinking that they have an artist before them, while in truth it is only
a pitiful comedian.No, the Jew possesses no culture-creating force of any sort,
since the idealism, without which there is no true higher development of
man, is not present in him and never was present. Hence his intellect will
never have a constructive effect, but will be destructive, and in very rare
cases perhaps will at most be stimulating, but then as the prototype of
the ' force which always wants evil and nevertheless creates good.' Not
through him does any progress of mankind occur, but in spite of him.Since the Jew never possessed a state with definite territorial
limits and therefore never called a culture his own, the conception arose
that this was a people which should be reckoned among the ranks of the nomads.
This is a fallacy as great as it is dangerous. The nomad does possess a
definitely limited living space, only he does not cultivate it like a sedentary
peasant, but lives from the yield of his herds with which he wanders about
in his territory. The outward reason for this is to be found in the small
fertility of a soil which simply does not permit of settlement. The deeper
cause, however, lies in the disparity between the technical culture of an
age or people and the natural poverty of a living space. There are territories
in which even the Aryan is enabled only by his technology, developed in
the course of more than a thousand years, to live in regular settlements,
to master broad stretches of soil and obtain from it the requirements of
life. If he did not possess this technology, either he would have to avoid
these territories or likewise have to struggle along as a nomad in perpetual
wandering, provided that his thousand-year-old education and habit of settled
residence did not make this seem simply unbearable to him. We must bear
in mind that in the time when the American continent was being opened up,
numerous Aryans fought for their livelihood as trappers, hunters, etc.,
and often in larger troops with wife and children, always on the move, so
that their existence was completely like that of the nomads. But as soon
as their increasing number and better implements permitted them to clear
the wild soil and make a stand against the natives, more and more settlements
sprang up in the land.Probably the Aryan was also first a nomad, settling in the course
of time, but for that very reason he was never a Jew! No, the Jew is no
nomad; for the nomad had also a definite attitude toward the concept of
work which could serve as a basis for his later development in so far as
the necessary intellectual premises were present. In him the basic idealistic
view is present, even if in infinite dilution, hence in his whole being
he may seem strange to the Aryan peoples, but not unattractive. In the Jew,
however, this attitude is not at all present; for that reason he was never
a nomad, but only and always a parasite in the body of other peoples. That
he sometimes left his previous living space has nothing to do with his own
purpose, but results from the fact that from time to time he was thrown
out by the host nations he had misused. His spreading is a typical phenomenon
for all parasites; he always seeks a new feeding ground for his race.This, however, has nothing to do with nomadism, for the reason
that a Jew never thinks of leaving a territory Phat he has occupied,
but remains where he is, and he sits so fast that even by force it is very
hard to drive him out. His extension to ever-new countries occurs only in
the moment in which certain conditions for his existence are there present,
without which- unlike the nomad-he would not change his residence. He is
and remains the typical parasite, a sponger who like a noxious bacillus
keeps spreading as soon as a favorable medium invites him. And the effect
of his existence is also like that of spongers: wherever he appears, the
host people dies out after a shorter or longer period.Thus, the Jew of all times has lived in the states of other
peoples, and there formed his own state, which, to be sure, habitually sailed
under the disguise of 'religious community' as long as outward circumstances
made a complete revelation of his nature seem inadvisable. But as soon as
he felt strong enough to do without the protective cloak, he always dropped
the veil and suddenly became what so many of the others previously did not
want to believe and see: the Jew.The Jew's life as a parasite in the body of other nations and
states explains a characteristic which once caused Schopenhauer, as has
already been mentioned, to call him the 'great master in lying.' Existence
impels the Jew to lies and to lie perpetually, just as it compels the inhabitants
of the northern countries to wear warm clothing.His life within other peoples can only endure for any length
of time if he succeeds in arousing the opinion that he is not a.people but
a 'religious community,' though of a special sort.And this is the first great lie.In order to carry on his existence as a parasite on other peoples,
he is forced to deny his inner nature. The more intelligent the individual
Jew is, the more he will succeed in this deception. Indeed, things can go
so far that large parts of the host people will end by seriously believing
that the Jew is really a Frenchman or an Englishman, a German or an Italian,
though of a special religious faith. Especially state authorities, which
always seem animated by the historical fraction of wisdom, most easily fall
a victim to this infinite deception. Independent thinking sometimes seems
to these circles a true sin against holy advancement, so that we may not
be surprised if even today a Bavarian state ministry, for example, still
has not the faintest idea that the Jews are members of a people and not
of a ' religion' though a glance at the Jew's own newspapers should indicate
this even to the most modest mind. The Jewish Echo is not yet an official
organ, of course, and consequently is unauthoritative as far as the intelligence
of one of these government potentates is concerned.The Jew has always been a people with definite racial characteristics
and never a religion; only in order to get ahead he early sought for a means
which could distract unpleasant attention from his person. And what would
have been more expedient and at the same time more innocent than the 'embezzled'
concept of a religious community? For here, too, everything is borrowed
or rather stolen. Due to his own original special nature, the Jew cannot
possess a religious institution, if for no other reason because he lacks
idealism in any form, and hence belief in a hereafter is absolutely foreign
to him. And a religion in the Aryan sense cannot be imagined which lacks
the conviction of survival after death in some form. Indeed, the Talmud
is not a book to prepare a man for the hereafter, but only for a practical
and profitable life in this world.The Jewish religious doctrine consists primarily in prescriptions
for keeping the blood of Jewry pure and for regulating the relation of Jews
among themselves, but even more with the rest of the world; in other words,
with non-Jews. But even here it is by no means ethical problems that are
involved, but extremely modest economic ones. Concerning the moral value
of Jewish religious instruction, there are today and have been at all times
rather exhaustive studies (not by Jews; the drivel of the Jews themselves
on the subject is, of course, adapted to its purpose) which make this kind
of religion seem positively monstrous according to Aryan conceptions. The
best characterization is provided by the product of this religious education,
the Jew himself. His life is only of this world, and his spirit is inwardly
as alien to true Christianity as his nature two thousand years previous
was to the great founder of the new doctrine. Of course, the latter made
no secret of his attitude toward the Jewish people, and when necessary he
even took to the whip to drive from the temple of the Lord this adversary
of all humanity, who then as always saw in religion nothing but an instrument
for his business existence. In return, Christ was nailed to the cross, while
our present-day party Christians debase themselves to begging for Jewish
votes at elections and later try to arrange political swindles with atheistic
Jewish parties-and this against their own nation.On this first and greatest lie, that the Jews are not a race
but a religion, more and more lies are based in necessary consequence. Among
them is the lie with regard to the language of the Jew. For him it is not
a means for expressing his thoughts, but a means for concealing them. When
he speaks French, he thinks Jewish, and while he turns out German verses,
in his life he only expresses the nature of his nationality. As long as
the Jew has not become the master of the other peoples, he must speak their
languages whether he likes it or not, but as soon as they became his slaves,
they would all have to learn a universal language (Esperanto, for instance!),
so that by this additional means the Jews could more easily dominate them!To what an extent the whole existence of this people is based
on a continuous lie is shown incomparably by the Protocols of the Wise Men
of Zion, so infinitely hated by the Jews. They are based on a forgery, the
Frankfurter Zeitung moans and screams once every week: the best proof that
they are authentic. What many Jews may do unconsciously is here consciously
exposed. And that is what matters. It is completely indifferent from what
Jewish brain these disclosures originate; the important thing is that with
positively terrifying certainty they reveal the nature and activity of the
Jewish people and expose their inner contexts as well as their ultimate
final aims. The best criticism applied to them, however, is reality. Anyone
who examines the historical development of the last hundred years from the
standpoint of this book will at once understand the screaming of the Jewish
press. For once this book has become the common property of a people, the
Jewish menace may be considered as broken.The best way to know the Jew is to study the road which he has
taken within the body of other peoples in the course of the centuries. It
suffices to follow this up in only one example, to arrive at the necessary
realizations. As his development has always and at all times been the same,
just as that of the peoples corroded by him has also been the same, it is
advisable in such an examination to divide his development into definite
sections which in this case for the sake of simplicity I designate alphabetically.
The first Jews came to ancient Germany in the course of the advance of the
Romans, and as always they came as merchants. In the storms of the migrations,
however, they seem to have disappeared again, and thus the time of the first
Germanic state formation may be viewed as the beginning of a new and this
time lasting Jewification of Central and Northern Europe. A development
set in which has always been the same or similar wherever the Jews encountered
Aryan peoples.(a) With the appearance of the first fixed settlement, the Jew
is suddenly 'at hand.' He comes as a merchant and at first attaches little
importance to the concealment of his nationality. He is still a Jew, partly
perhaps among other reasons because the outward racial difference between
himself and the host people is too great, his linguistic knowledge still
too small, and the cohesion of the host people too sharp for him to dare
to try to appear as anything else than a foreign merchant. With his dexterity
and the inexperience of his host people, the retention of his character
as a Jew represents no disadvantage for him, but rather an advantage; the
stranger is given a friendly reception.(b) Gradually he begins slowly to become active in economic
life, not as a producer, but exclusively as a middleman. With his thousand-year-old
mercantile dexterity he is far superior to the still helpless, and above
all boundlessly honest, Aryans, so that in a short time commerce threatens
to become his monopoly. He begins to lend money and as always at usurious
interest. As a matter of fact, he thereby introduces interest. The danger
of this new institution is not recognized at first, but because of its momentary
advantages is even welcomed.(c) The Jew has now become a steady resident; that is, he settles
special sections of the cities and villages and more and more constitutes
a state within a state. He regards commerce as well as all financial transactions
as his own special privilege which he ruthlessly exploits.(d) Finance and commerce have become his complete monopoly.
His usurious rates of interest finally arouse resistance, the rest of his
increasing effrontery indignation, his wealth envy. The cup is full to overflowing
when he draws the soil into the sphere of his commercial objects and degrades
it to the level of a commodity to be sold or rather traded. Since he himself
never cultivates the soil, but regards it only as a property to be exploited
on which the peasant can well remain, though amid the most miserable extortions
on the part of his new master, the aversion against him gradually increases
to open hatred. His blood-sucking tyranny becomes so great that excesses
against him occur. People begin to look at the foreigner more and more closely
and discover more and more repulsive traits and characteristics in him until
the cleft becomes unbridgeable.At times of the bitterest distress, fury against him finally
breaks out, and the plundered and ruined masses begin to defend themselves
against the scourge of God. In the course of a few centuries they have come
to know him, and now they feel that the mere fact of his existence is as
bad as the plague.(e) Now the Jew begins to reveal his true qualities. With repulsive
flattery he approaches the governments, puts his money to work, and in this
way always manages to secure new license to plunder his victims. Even though
the rage of the people sometimes flares high against the eternal blood-sucker,
it does not in the least prevent him from reappearing in a few years in
the place he had hardly left and beginning the old life all over again.
No persecution can deter him from his type of human exploitation, none can
drive him away; after every persecution he is back again in a short time,
and just the same as before.To prevent the very worst, at least, the people begin to withdraw
the soil from his usurious hands by making it legally impossible for him
to acquire soil.(f) Proportionately as the power of the princes begins to mount,
he pushes closer and closer to them. He begs for ' patents ' and 'privileges,'
which the lords, always in financial straits, are glad to give him for suitable
payment. However much this may cost him, he recovers the money he has spent
in a few years through interest and compound interest. A true blood-sucker
that attaches himself to the body of the unhappy people and cannot be picked
off until the princes themselves again need money and with their own exalted
hand tap off the blood he has sucked from them.This game is repeated again and again, and in it the role of
the so-called 'German princes' is just as miserable as that of the Jews
themselves. These lords were really God's punishment for their beloved peoples
and find their parallels only in the various ministers of the present time.It is thanks to the German princes that the German nation was
unable to redeem itself for good from the Jewish menace. In this, too, unfortunately,
nothing changed as time went on; all they obtained from the Jew was the
thousandfold reward for the sins they had once committed against their peoples.
They made a pact with the devil and landed in hell.(g) And so, his ensnarement of the princes leads to their ruin.
Slowly but surely their relation to the peoples loosens in the measure in
which they cease to serve the people's interests and instead become mere
exploiters of their subjects. The Jew well knows what their end will be
and tries to hasten it as much as possible. He himself adds to their financial
straits by alienating them more and more from their true tasks, by crawling
around them with the vilest flattery, by encouraging them in vices, and
thus making himself more and more indispensable to them. With his deftness,
or rather unscrupulousness, in all money matters he is able to squeeze,
yes, to grind, more and more money out of the plundered subjects, who in
shorter and shorter intervals go the way of all flesh. Thus every court
has its 'court Jew'-as the monsters are called who torment the 'beloved
people' to despair and prepare eternal pleasures for the princes. Who then
can be surprised that these ornaments of the human race ended up by being
ornamented, or rather decorated, in the literal sense, and rose to the hereditary
nobility, helping not only to make this institution ridiculous, but even
to poison it?Now, it goes without saying, he can really make use of his position
for his own advancement.Finally he needs only to have himself baptized to possess himself
of all the possibilities and rights of the natives of the country. Not seldom
he concludes this deal to the joy of the churches over the son they have
won and of Israel over the successful swindle.(h) Within Jewry a change now begins to take place. Up till
now they have been Jews; that is, they attach no importance to appearing
to be something else, which they were unable to do, anyway, because of the
very distinct racial characteristics on both sides. At the time of Frederick
the Great it still entered no one's head to regard the Jew as anything else
but a 'foreign' people, and Goethe was still horrified at the thought that
in future marriage between Christians and Jews would no longer be forbidden
by law. And Goethe, by God, was no reactionary, let alone a helot; I what
spoke out of him was only the voice of the blood and of reason. Thus-despite
all the shameful actions of the courts-the people instinctively saw in the
Jew a foreign element and took a corresponding attitude toward him.But now all this was to change. In the course of more than a
thousand years he has learned the language of the host people to such an
extent that he now thinks he can venture in future to emphasize his Judaism
less and place his 'Germanism' more in the foreground; for ridiculous, nay,
insane, as it may seem at first, he nevertheless has the effrontery to turn
'Germanic,' in this case a 'German.' With this begins one of the most infamous
deceptions that anyone could conceive of. Since of Germanism he possesses
really nothing but the art of stammering its language -and in the most frightful
way-but apart from this has never mixed with the Germans, his whole Germanism
rests on the language alone. Race, however, does not lie in the language,
but exclusively in the blood, which no one knows better than the Jew, who
attaches very little importance to the preservation of his language, but
all importance to keeping his blood pure. A man can change his language
without any trouble-that is, he can use another language; but in his new
language he will express the old ideas; his inner nature is not changed.
This is best shown by the Jew who can speak a thousand languages and nevertheless
remains a Jew. His traits of character have remained the same, whether two
thousand years ago as a grain dealer in Ostia, speaking Roman, or whether
as a flour profiteer of today, jabbering German with a Jewish accent. It
is always the same Jew. That this obvious fact is not understood by a ministerial
secretary or higher police official is also self-evident, for there is scarcely
any creature with less instinct and intelligence running around in the world
today than these servants of our present model state authority.The reason why the Jew decides suddenly to become a 'German
' is obvious. He feels that the power of the princes is slowly tottering
and therefore tries at an early time to get a platform beneath his feet.
Furthermore, his financial domination of the whole economy has advanced
so far that without possession of all 'civil' rights he can no longer support
the gigantic edifice, or at any rate, no further increase of his influence
is possible. And he desires both of these; for the higher he climbs, the
more alluring his old goal that was once promised him rises from the veil
of the past, and with feverish avidity his keenest minds see the dream of
world domination tangibly approaching. And so his sole effort is directed
toward obtaining full possession of 'civil' rights.This is the reason for his emancipation from the ghetto.(i) So from the court Jew there-gradually develops the people's
Jew, which means, of course: the Jew remains as before in the entourage
of the high lords; in fact,-he tries to push his way even more into their
circle; but at the same time another part of his race makes friends with
the ' beloved people. ' If we consider how greatly he has sinned against
the masses in the course of the centuries, how he has squeezed and sucked
their blood again and again; if furthermore, we consider how the people
gradually learned to hate him for this, and ended up by regarding his existence
as nothing but a punishment of Heaven for the other peoples, we can understand
how hard this shift must be for the Jew. Yes, it is an arduous task suddenly
to present himself to his flayed victims as a 'friend of mankind.'First, therefore, he goes.about making up to the people for
his previous sins against them. He begins his career as the 'benefactor'
of mankind. Since his new benevolence has a practical foundation, he cannot
very well adhere to the old Biblical recommendation, that the left hand
should not know what the right hand giveth; no, whether he likes it or not,
he must reconcile himself to letting as many people as possible know how
deeply he feels the sufferings of the masses and all the sacrifices that
he himself is making to combat them. With this 'modesty ' which is inborn
in him, he blares out his merits to the rest of the world until people really
begin to believe in them. Anyone who does not believe in them is doing him
a bitter injustice. In a short time he begins to twist things around to
make it look as if all the injustice in the world had always been done to
him and not the other way around. The very stupid believe this and then
they just can't help but pity the poor 'unfortunate.'In addition, it should be remarked here that the Jew, despite
all his love of sacrifice, naturally never becomes personally impoverished.
He knows how to manage; sometimes, indeed, his charity is really comparable
to fertilizer, which is not strewn on the field for love of the field, but
with a view to the farmer's own future benefit. In any case, everyone knows
in a comparatively short time that the Jew has become a 'benefactor and
friend of mankind.' What a strange transformation!But what is more or less taken for granted in others arouses
the greatest astonishment and in many distinct admiration for this very
reason. So it happens that he gets much more credit for every such action
than the rest of mankind, in whom it is taken for granted.But even more: all at once the Jew also becomes liberal and
begins to rave about the necessary progress of mankind.
Slowly he makes himself the spokesman of a new era.Also, of course, he destroys more and more thoroughly the foundations
of any economy that will really benefit the people. By way of stock shares
he pushes his way into the circuit of national production which he turns
into a purchasable or rather tradable object, thus robbing the enterprises
of the foundations of a personal ownership. Between employer and employee
there arises that inner estrangement which later leads to political class
division.Finally, the Jewish influence on economic affairs grows with
terrifying speed through the stock exchange. He becomes the owner, or at
least the controller, of the national labor force.To strengthen his political position he tries to tear down the
racial and civil barriers which for a time continue to restrain him at every
step. To this end he fights with all the tenacity innate in him for religious
tolerance-and in Freemasonry, which has succumbed to him completely, he
has an excellent instrument with which to fight for his aims and put them
across. The governing circles and the higher strata of the political and
economic bourgeoisie are brought into his nets by the strings of Freemasonry,
and never need to suspect what is happeningOnly the deeper and broader strata of the people as such, or
rather that class which is beginning to wake up and fight for its rights
and freedom, cannot yet be sufficiently taken in by these methods. But this
is more necessary than anything else; for the Jew feels that the possibility
of his rising to a dominant role exists only if there is someone ahead of
him to dear the way; and this someone he thinks he can recognize in the
bourgeoisie, in their broadest strata in fact. The glovemakers and linen
weavers, however, cannot be caught in the fine net of Freemasonry; no, for
them coarser but no less drastic means must be employed. Thus Freemasonry
is joined by a second weapon in the service of the Jews: the press. With
all his perseverance and dexterity he seizes possession of it. With it he
slowly begins to grip and ensnare, to guide and to push all public life,
since he is in a position to create and direct that power which, under the
name of 'public opinion,' IS better known today than a few decades ago.In this he always represents himself personally as having an
infinite thirst for knowledge, praises all progress, mostly, to be sure,
the progress that leads to the ruin of others; for he judges all knowledge
and all development only according to its possibilities for advancing his
nation, and where this is lacking, he is the inexorable mortal enemy of
all light, a hater of all true culture. He uses all the knowledge he acquires
in the schools of other peoples, exclusively for the benefit of his race.And this nationality he guards as never before. While he seems
to overflow with 'enlightenment,' 'progress,' 'freedom,' 'humanity,' etc.,
he himself practices the severest segregation of his race. To be sure, he
sometimes palms off his women on influential Christians, but as a matter
of principle he always keeps his male line pure. He poisons the blood of
others, but preserves his own. The Jew almost never marries a Christian
woman; it is the Christian who marries a Jewess. The bastards, however,
take after the Jewish side. Especially a part of the high nobility degenerates
completely. The Jew is perfectly aware of this, and therefore systematically
carries on this mode of ' disarming ' the intellectual leader class of his
racial adversaries. In order to mask his activity and lull his victims,
however, he talks more and more of the equality of all men without regard
to race and color. The fools begin to believe him.Since, however, his whole being still has too strong a smell
of the foreign for the broad masses of the people in particular to fall
readily into his nets, he has his press give a picture of him which is as
little in keeping with reality as conversely it serves his desired purpose.
His comic papers especially strive to represent the Jews as a harmless little
people, with their own peculiarities, of course-like other peoples as well-but
even in their gestures, which seem a little strange, perhaps, giving signs
of a possibly ludicrous, but always thoroughly honest and benevolent, soul.
And the constant effort is to make him seem almost more 'insignificant'
than dangerous.His ultimate goal in this stage is the victory of ' democracy,'
or, as he understands it: the rule of parliamentarianism. It is most compatible
with his requirements; for it excludes the personality-and puts in its place
the majority characterized by stupidity, incompetence, and last but not
least, cowardice. The final result will be the overthrow of the monarchy, which
is now sooner or later bound to occur.(j) The tremendous economic development leads to a change in
the social stratification of the people. The small craftsman slowly dies
out, and as a result the worker's possibility of achieving an independent
existence becomes rarer and rarer; in consequence the worker becomes visibly
proletarianized. There arises the industrial ' factory worker ' whose most
essential characteristic is to be sought in the fact that he hardly ever
is in a position to found an existence of his own in later life. He is propertyless
in the truest sense of the word. His old age is a torment and can scarcely
be designated as living.Once before, a similar situation was created, which pressed
urgently for a solution and also found one. The peasants and artisans had
slowly been joined by the officials and salaried workers-particularly of
the state-as a new class. They, too, were propertyless in the truest sense
of the word. The state finally found a way out of this unhealthy condition
by assuming the care of the state employee who could not himself provide
for his old age; it introduced the pension. Slowly, more and more enterprises
followed this example, so that nearly every regularly employed brain-worker
draws a pension in later life, provided the concern he works in has achieved
or surpassed a certain size. Only by safeguarding the state official in
his old age could he be taught the selfless devotion to duty which in the
pre-War period was the most eminent quality of German officialdom.In this way a whole class that had remained propertyless was
wisely snatched away from social misery and articulated with the body of
the people.Now this question again, and this time on a much larger scale,
faced the state and the nation. More and more masses of people, numbering
millions, moved from peasant villages to the larger cities to earn their
bread as factory workers in the newly established industries. The working
and living conditions of the new class were more than dismal. If nothing
else, the more or less mechanical transference of the old artisan's or even
peasant's working methods to the new form was by no means suitable. The
work done by these men could not be compared with the exertions which the
industrial factory worker has to perform. In the old handicraft, this may
not have been very important, but in the new working methods it was all
the more so. The formal transference of the old working hours to the industrial
large-scale enterprise was positively catastrophic, for the actual work
done before was but little in view of the absence of our present intensive
working methods. Thus, though previously the fourteen-or even fifteen-hour
working day had been bearable, it certainly ceased to be bearable at a time
when every minute was exploited to the fullest. The result of this senseless
transference of the old working hours to the new industrial activity was
really unfortunate in two respects: the worker's health was undermined and
his faith in a higher justice destroyed. To this finally was added the miserable
wages on the one hand and the employer's correspondingly and obviously so
vastly superior position on the other.In the country there could be no social question, since master
and hired hand did the same work and above all ate out of the same bowls.
But this, too, changed.The separation of worker and employer now seems complete in
all fields of life. How far the inner Judaization of our people has progressed
can be seen from the small respect, if not contempt, that is accorded to
manual labor. This is not German. It took the foreignization of our life,
which was in truth a Jewification, to transform the old respect for manual
work into a certain contempt for all physical labor.Thus, there actually comes into being a new class enjoying very
little respect, and one day the question must arise whether the nation would
possess the strength to articulate the new class into general society, or
whether the social difference would broaden into a classlike cleavage.But one thing is certain: the new class did not count the worst
elements in its ranks, but on the contrary definitely the most
energetic elements. The overrefinements of so-called culture had not yet
exerted their disintegrating and destructive effects. The broad mass of
the new class was not yet infected with the poison of pacifist weakness;
it was robust and if necessary even brutal.While the bourgeoisie is not at all concerned about this all-important
question, but indifferently lets things slide, the Jew seizes the unlimited
opportunity it offers for the future; while on the one hand he organizes
capitalistic methods of human exploitation to their ultimate consequence,
he approaches the very victims of his spirit and his activity and in a short
time becomes the leader of their struggle against himself. 'Against himself'
is only figuratively speaking; for the great master of lies understands
as always how to make himself appear to be the pure one and to load the
blame on others. Since he has th gall to lead the masses, it never even
enters their heads that this might be the most in
famous betrayal of all times.And yet it was.Scarcely has the new class grown out of the general economic
shift than the Jew, clearly and distinctly, realizes that it can open the
way for his own further advancement. First, he used the bourgeoisie as a
battering-ram against the feudal world, then the worker against the bourgeois
world. If formerly he knew how to swindle his way to civil rights in the
shadow of the bourgeoisie, now he hopes to find the road to his own domination
in the worker's struggle for existence.
From now on the worker has no other task but to fight for the future of
the Jewish people. Unconsciously he is harnessed to the service of the power
which he thinks he is combating. He is seemingly allowed to attack capital,
and this is the easiest way of making him fight for it. In this the Jew
keeps up an outcry against international capital and in truth he means the
national economy which must be demolished in order that the international
stock exchange can triumph over its dead body.Here the Jew's procedure is as follows:He approaches the worker, simulates pity with his fate, or even
indignation at his lot of misery and poverty, thus gaining his confidence.
He takes pains to study all the various real or imaginary hardships of his
life-and to arouse his longing for a change in such an existence. With infinite
shrewdness he fans the need for social justice, somehow slumbering in every
Aryan man, into hatred against those who have been better favored by fortune,
and thus gives the struggle for the elimination of social evils a very definite
philosophical stamp. He establishes the Marxist doctrine.By presenting it as inseparably bound up with a number of socially
just demands, he promotes its spread and conversely the aversion of decent
people to fulfill demands which, advanced in such form and company, seem
from the outset unjust and impossible to fulfill. For under this cloak of
purely social ideas truly diabolic purposes are hidden, yes, they are publicly
proclaimed with the most insolent frankness. This theory represents an inseparable
mixture of reason and human madness, but always in such a way that only
the lunacy can become reality and never the reason. By the categorical rejection
of the personality and hence of the nation and its racial content, it destroys
the elementary foundations of all human culture which is dependent on just
these factors. This is the true inner kernel of the Marxist philosophy in
so far as this figment of a criminal brain can be designated as a 'philosophy.'
With the shattering of the personality and the race, the essential obstacle
is removed to the domination of the inferior being-and this is the Jew.Precisely in political and economic madness lies the sense of
this doctrine. For this prevents all truly intelligent people from entering
its service, while those who are intellectually less active and poorly educated
in economics hasten to it with flying colors. The intellectuals for this
movement-for even this movement needs intellectuals for its existence-are
' sacrificed ' by the Jew from his own ranks.Thus there arises a pure movement entirely of manual workers
under Jewish leadership, apparently aiming to improve the situation of the
worker, but in truth planning the enslavement and with it the destruction
of all non-Jewish peoples.The general pacifistic paralysis of the national instinct of
selfpreservation begun by Freemasonry in the circles of the so-called intelligentsia
is transmitted to the broad masses and above all to the bourgeoisie by the
activity of the big papers which today are always Jewish. Added to these
two weapons of disintegration comes a third and by far the most terrible,
the organization of brute force. As a shock and storm troop, Marxism is
intended to finish off what the preparatory softening up with the first
two weapons has made ripe for collapse.Here we have teamwork that is positively brilliant-and we need
really not be surprised if in confronting it those very institutions which
always like to represent themselves as the pillars of a more or less legendary
state authority hold up least. It is in our high and highest state officialdom
that the Jew has at all times (aside from a few exceptions) found the most
compliant abettor of his work of disintegration. Cringing submissiveness
to superiors and high-handed arrogance to inferiors distinguish this class
to the same degree as a narrow-mindedness that often cries to high Heaven
and is only exceeded by a self-conceit that is sometimes positively amazing.And these are qualities that the Jew needs in our authorities
and loves accordingly.The practical struggle which now begins, sketched in broad outlines,
takes the following course:In keeping with the ultimate aims of the Jewish struggle, which
are not exhausted in the mere economic conquest of the world, but also demand
its political subjugation, the Jew divides the organization of his Marxist
world doctrine into two halves which, apparently separate from one another,
in truth form an inseparable whole: the political and the trade-union movement.The trade-union movement does the recruiting. In the hard struggle
for existence which the worker must carry on, thanks to the greed and shortsightedness
of many employers, it offers him aid and protection, and thus the possibility
of winning better living conditions. If, at a time when the organized national
community, the state, concerns itself with him little or not at all, the
worker does not want to hand over the defense of his vital human rights
to the blind caprice of people who in part have little sense of responsibility
and are often heartless to boot, he must take their defense into his own
hands. In exact proportion as the so-called national bourgeoisie, blinded
by financial interests, sets the heaviest obstacles in the path of this
struggle for existence and not only resists all attempts at shortening the
inhumanly long working day, abolishing child labor, safeguarding and protecting
the woman, improving sanitary conditions in the workshops and homes, but
often actually sabotages them, the shrewder Jew takes the oppressed people
under his wing. Gradually he be comes the leader of the trade-union movement,
all the more easily as he is not interested in really eliminating social
evils in an honest sense, but only in training an economic storm troop,
blindly devoted to him, with which to destroy the national economic independence.
For while the conduct of a healthy social policy will consistently move
between the aims of preserving the national health on the one hand and safeguarding
an independent national economy on the other, for the Jew in his struggle
these two criteria not only cease to exist, but their elimination, among
other things, is his life goal. He desires, not the preservation of an independent
national economy, but its destruction. Consequently, no pangs of conscience
can prevent him as a leader of the trade-union movement from raising demands
which not only overshoot the goal, but whose fulfillment is either impossible
for practical purposes or means the ruin of the national economy. Moreover,
he does not want to have a healthy, sturdy race before him, but a rickety
herd capable of being subjugated. This desire again permits him to raise
demands of the most senseless kind whose practical fulfillment he himself
knows to be impossible and which, therefore, could not lead to any change
in things, but at most to a wild incitement of the masses. And that is what
he is interested in and not a true and honest improvement of social conditions.Hence the Jewish leadership in trade-union affairs remains uncontested
until an enormous work of enlightenment influences the broad masses and
sets them right about their never-ending misery, or else the state disposes
of the Jew and his work. For as long as the insight of the masses remains
as slight as now and the state as indifferent as today, these masses will
always be first to follow the man who in economic matters offers the most
shameless promises. And in this the Jew is a master. For in his entire activity
he is restrained by no moral scruples!And so he inevitably drives every competitor in this sphere
from the field in a short time. In keeping with all his inner rapacious
brutality, he at once teaches the trade-union movement the most brutal use
of violence. If anyone by his intelligence resists the Jewish lures, his
defiance and understanding are broken by terror. The success of such an
activity is enormous.Actually the Jew by means of the trade union, which could be
a blessing for the nation, shatters the foundations of the national economy.Parallel with this, the political organization advances.It plays hand in glove with the trade-union movement, for the
latter prepares the masses for political organization, in fact, lashes them
into it with violence and coercion. Furthermore, it is the permanent financial
source from which the political organization feeds its enormous apparatus.
It is the organ controlling the political activity of the individual and
does the pandering in all big demonstrations of a political nature. In the
end it no longer comes out for political interests at all, but places its
chief instrument of struggle, the cessation of work in the form of a mass
and general strike, in the service of the political idea.By the creation of a press whose content is adapted to the intellectual
horizon of the least educated people, the political and trade-union organization
finally obtains the agitational institution by which the lowest strata of
the nation are made ripe for the most reckless acts. Its function is not
to lead people out of the swamp of a base mentality to a higher stage, but
to cater to their lowest instincts. Since the masses are as mentally lazy
as they are sometimes presumptuous, this is a business as speculative as
it is profitable.It is this press, above all, which wages a positively fanatical
and slanderous struggle, tearing down everything which can be regarded as
a support of national independence, cultural elevation, and the economic
independence of the nation.Above all, it hammers away at the characters of all those who
will not bow down to the Jewish presumption to dominate, or whose ability
and genius in themselves seem a danger to the Jew. For to be hated by the
Jew it is not necessary to combat him; no, it suffices if he suspects that
someone might even conceive the idea of combating him some time or that
on the strength of his superior genius he is an augmenter of the power and
greatness of a nationality hostile to the Jew.His unfailing instinct in such things scents the original soul
l in everyone, and his hostility is assured to anyone who is not spirit
of his spirit. Since the Jew is not the attacked but the attacker, not only
anyone who attacks passes as his enemy, but also anyone who resists him.
But the means with which he seeks to break such reckless but upright souls
is not honest warfare, but lies and slander.Here he stops at nothing, and in his vileness he becomes so
gigantic that no one need be surprised if among our people the personification
of the devil as the symbol of all evil assumes the living shape of the Jew.The ignorance of the broad masses about the inner nature of
the Jew, the lack of instinct and narrow-mindedness of our upper classes,
make the people an easy victim for this Jewish campaign of lies.While from innate cowardice the upper classes turn away from
a man whom the Jew attacks with lies and slander, the broad masses from
stupidity or simplicity believe everything. The state authorities either
cloak themselves in silence or, what usually happens, in order to put an
end to the Jewish press campaign, they persecute the unjustly attacked,
which, in the eyes of such an official ass, passes as the preservation of
state authority and the safeguarding of law and order.Slowly fear of the Marxist weapon of Jewry descends like a nightmare
on the mind and soul of decent people.They begin to tremble before the terrible enemy and thus have
become his final victim.The Jew's domination in the state seems so assured that now
not only can he call himself a Jew again, but he ruthlessly admits his ultimate
national and political designs. A section of his race openly owns itself
to be a foreign people, yet even here they lie. For while the Zionists try
to make the rest of the world believe that the national consciousness of
the Jew finds its satisfaction in the creation of a Palestinian state, the
Jews again slyly dupe the dumb Goyim. It doesn't even enter their heads
to build up a Jewish state in Palestine for the purpose of living there;
all they want is a central organization for their international world swindle,
endowed with its own sovereign rights and removed from the intervention
of other states: a haven for convicted scoundrels and a university for budding
crooks.It is a sign of their rising confidence and sense of security
that at a time when one section is still playing the German, Frenchman,
or Englishman, the other with open effrontery comes out as the Jewish race.How close they see approaching victory can be seen by the hideous
aspect which their relations with the members of
other peoples takes on.With satanic joy in his face, the black-haired Jewish youth
lurks in wait for the unsuspecting girl whom he defiles with his blood,
thus stealing her from her people. With every means he tries to destroy
the racial foundations of the people he has set out to subjugate. Just as
he himself systematically ruins women and girls, he does not shrink back
from pulling down the blood barriers for others, even on a large scale.
It was and it is Jews who bring the Negroes into the Rhineland, always with
the same secret thought and clear aim of ruining the hated white race by
the necessarily resulting bastardization, throwing it down from its cultural
and political height, and himself rising to be its master.For a racially pure people which is conscious of its blood can
never be enslaved by the Jew. In this world he will forever be master over
bastards and bastards alone.And so he tries systematically to lower the racial level by
a continuous poisoning of individuals.And in politics he begins to replace the idea of democracy by
the dictatorship of the proletariat.In the organized mass of Marxism he has found the weapon which
lets him dispense with democracy and in its stead allows him to subjugate
and govern the peoples with a dictatorial and brutal fist.He works systematically for revolutionization in a twofold sense:
economic and political.Around peoples who offer too violent a resistance to attack
from within he weaves a net of enemies, thanks to his international influence,
incites them to war, and finally, if necessary, plants the flag of revolution
on the very battlefields.In economics he undermines the states until the social enterprises
which have become unprofitable are taken from the state and subjected to
his financial control.In the political field he refuses the state the means for its
selfpreservation, destroys the foundations of all national self-maintenance
and defense, destroys faith in the leadership, scoffs at its history and
past, and drags everything that is truly great into the gutter.Culturally he contaminates art, literature, the theater, makes
a mockery of natural feeling, overthrows all concepts of beauty and sublimity,
of the noble and the good, and instead drags men down into the sphere of
his own base nature.
Religion is ridiculed, ethics and morality represented as outmoded, until
the last props of a nation in its struggle for existence in this world have
fallen.(e) Now begins the great last revolution. In gaining political
power the Jew casts off the few cloaks that he still wears. The democratic
people's Jew becomes the blood-Jew and tyrant over peoples. In a few years
he tries to exterminate the national intelligentsia and by robbing the peoples
of their natural intellectual leadership makes them ripe for the slave's
lot of permanent subjugation.The most frightful example of this kind is offered by Russia, where he killed or starved about thirty million people with positively fanatical savagery, in part amid inhuman tortures, in order to give a gang of Jewish journalists and stock exchange bandits domination over a great people.The end is not only the end of the freedom of the peoples oppressed by the Jew, but also the end of this parasite upon the nations. After the death of his victim, the vampire sooner or later dies too.If we pass all the causes of the German collapse in review,
the ultimate and most decisive remains the failure to recognize the racial
problem and especially the Jewish menace.The defeats on the battlefield in August, 1918, would have been child's play to bear. They stood in no proportion to the victories of our people. It was not they that caused our downfall; no, it was brought about by that power which prepared these defeats by systematically over many decades robbing our people of the political and moral instincts and forces which alone make nations capable and hence worthy of existence.In heedlessly ignoring -the question of the preservation of
the racial foundations of our nation, the old Reich disregarded the sole
right which gives life in this world. Peoples which bastardize themselves,
or let themselves be bastardized, sin against the will of eternal Providence,
and when their ruin is encompassed by a stronger enemy it is not an injustice
done to them, but only the restoration of justice. If a people no longer
wants to respect the Nature-given qualities of its being which root in its
blood, it has no further right to complain over the loss of its earthly
existence.Everything on this earth is capable of improvement. Every defeat can become
the father of a subsequent victory, every lost war the cause of a later
resurgence, every hardship the fertilization of human energy, and from every
oppression the forces for a new spiritual rebirth can comes as long as the
blood is preserved pure.The lost purity of the blood alone destroys inner happiness
forever, plunges man into the abyss for all time, and the consequences can
never more be eliminated from body and spirit.Only by examining and comparing all other problems of life in
the light of this one question shall we see how absurdly petty they are
by this standard. They are all limited in time-but the question of preserving
or not preserving the purity of the blood will endure as long as there are
men.All really significant symptoms of decay of the pre-War period
can in the last analysis be reduced to racial causes.Whether we consider questions of general justice or cankers
of economic life, symptoms of cultural decline or processes of political
degeneration, questions of faulty schooling or the bad influence exerted
on grown-ups by the press, etc., everywhere and always it is fundamentally
the disregard of the racial needs of our own people or failure to see a
foreign racial menace.
And that is why all attempts at reform, all works for social relief and
political exertions, all economic expansion and every apparent increase
of intellectual knowledge were futile as far as their results were concerned.
The nation, and the organism which enables l and preserves its life on this
earth, the state, did not grow inwardly healthier, but obviously languished
more and more. All the illusory prosperity of the old Reich could not hide
its inner weakness, and every attempt really to strengthen the Reich failed
again and again, due to disregarding the most important question.It would be a mistake to believe that the adherents of the various
political tendencies which were tinkering around on the German national
body-yes, even a certain section of the leaders-were bad or malevolent men
in themselves. Their activity was condemned to sterility only because the
best of them saw at most the forms of our general disease and tried to combat
them, but blindly ignored the virus. Anyone who systematically follows the
old Reich's line of political development is bound to arrive, upon calm
examination, at the realization that even at the time of the unification,
hence the rise of the German nation, the inner decay was already in full
swing, and that despite all apparent political successes and despite increasing
economic wealth, the general situation was deteriorating from year to year.
If nothing else, the elections for the Reichstag announced, with their outward
swelling of the Marxist vote, the steadily approaching inward and hence
also outward collapse. All the successes of the so-called bourgeois parties
were worthless, not only because even with so-called bourgeois electoral
victories they were unable to halt the numerical growth of the Marxist flood,
but because they themselves above all now bore the ferments of decay in
their own bodies. Without suspecting it, the bourgeois world itself was
inwardly infected with the deadly poison of Marxist ideas and its resistance
often sprang more from the competitor's envy of ambitious leaders than from
a fundamental rejection of adversaries determined to fight to the utmost.
In these long years there was only one who kept up an imperturbable, unflagging
fight, and this was the Jean His Star of David I rose higher and higher
in proportion as our people's will for selfpreservation vanished.Therefore, in August, 1914, it was not a people resolved to attack which rushed to the battlefield; no, it was only the last flicker of the national instinct of self-preservation in face of the progressing pacifist-Marxist paralysis of our national body. Since even in these days of destiny, our people did not recognize the inner enemy, all outward resistance

was in vain and Providence did not bestow her reward on the victorious sword, but followed the law of eternal retribution.On the basis of this inner realization, there took form in our new movement the leading principles as well as the tendency, which in our conviction were alone capable, not only of halting the decline of the German people, but of creating the granite foundation upon which some day a state will rest which represents, not an alien mechanism of economic concerns

and interests, but a national organism:


 Lowering of the level of the higher race; Physical and intellectual regression and hence the beginning of a slowly but surely progressing sickness.




IF AT THE END of this volume I describe the first period in
the development of our movement and briefly discuss a number of questions
it raises, my aim is not to give a dissertation on the spiritual aims of
the movement. The aims and tasks of the new movement are so gigantic that
they can only be treated in a special volume. In a second volume, therefore,
I shall discuss the programmatic foundations of the movement in detail and
attempt to draw a picture of what we conceive of under the word 'state.'
By 'us' I mean all the hundreds of thousands who fundamentally long for
the same thing without as individuals finding the words to describe outwardly
I what they inwardly visualize; for the noteworthy fact about all reforms
is that at first they possess but a single champion yet many million supporters.
Their aim has often been for centuries the inner longing of hundreds of
thousands, until one man stands up to proclaim such a general will, and
as a standard-bearer guides the old longing to victory in the form of the
new idea.The fact that millions bear in their hearts the desire for a
basic change in the conditions obtaining today proves the deep discontent
under which they suffer. It expresses itself in thousandfold manifestations
with one in despair and hopelessness, with another in ill will, anger, and
indignation; with this man in indifference, and with that man in furious
excesses. As witnesses to this inner dissatisfaction we may consider those
who are weary of elections as well as the many who tend to the most fanatical
extreme of the Left.The young movement was intended primarily to appeal to these
last. It is not meant to constitute an organization of the contented and
satisfied, but to embrace those tormented by suffering, those without peace,
the unhappy and the discontented, and above all it must not swim on the
surface of a national body, but strike roots deep within it.In purely political terms, the following picture presented
itself in 1918: a people torn into two parts. The one, by far the smaller,
includes the strata of the national intelligentsia, excluding all the physically
active. It is outwardly national, yet under this word can conceive of nothing
but a very insipid and weak-kneed defense of so-called state interests,
which in turn seem identical with dynastic interests. They attempt to fight
for their ideas and aims with spiritual weapons which are as fragmentary
as they are superficial, and which fail completely in the face of the enemy's
brutality. With a single frightful blow this class, which only a short time
before was still governing, is stretched on the ground and with trembling
cowardice suffers every humiliation at the hands of the ruthless victor.Confronting it is a second class, the broad mass of the laboring
population. It is organized in more or less radical Marxist movements, determined
to break all spiritual resistance by the power of violence. It does not
want to be national, but consciously rejects any promotion of national interests,
just as, conversely, it aids and abets all foreign oppression. It is numerically
the stronger and above all comprises all those elements of the nation without
which a national resurrection is unthinkable and impossible.For in 1918 this much was clear: no resurrection of the German
people can occur except through the recovery of outward power. But the prerequisites
for this are not arms, as our bourgeois 'statesmen ' keep prattling, but
the forces of the will. The German people had more than enough arms before.
They were not able to secure freedom because the energies of the national
instinct of self-preservation, the will for self-preservation, were lacking.
The best weapon is dead, worthless material as long as the spirit is lacking
which is ready, willing, and determined to use it. Germany became defenseless,
not because arms were lacking, but because the will was lacking to guard
the weapon for national survival.If today more than ever our Left politicians are at pains to
point out the lack of arms as the necessary cause of their spineless, compliant,
actually treasonous policy, we must answer only one thing: no, the reverse
is true. Through your anti-national, criminal policy of abandoning national
interests, you surrendered our arms. Now you attempt to represent the lack
of arms as the underlying cause of your miserable villainy. This, like everything
you do, is lees and falsification.But this reproach applies just as much to the politicians on
the Right. For, thanks to their miserable cowardice, the Jewish rabble that
had come to power was able in 1918 to steal the nation's arms. They, too,
have consequently no ground and no right to palm off our present lack of
arms as the compelling ground for their wily caution (read ' cowardice ');
on the contrary, our defenselessness is the consequence of their cowardice.Consequently the question of regaining German power is not:
How shall we manufacture arms? but: How shall we manufacture the spirit
which enables a people to bear arms? If this spirit dominates a people,
the will finds a thousand ways, every one of which ends in a weapon ! But
give a coward ten pistols and if attacked he will not be able to fire a
single shot. And so for him they are more worthless than a knotted stick
for a courageous man.The question of regaining our people's political power is primarily
a question of recovering our national instinct of self preservation, if
for no other reason because experience shows that any preparatory foreign
policy, as well as any evaluation of a state as such, takes its cue less
from the existing weapons than from a nation's recognized or presumed moral
capacity for resistance. A nation1s ability to form alliances is determined
much less by dead stores of existing arms than by the visible presence of
an ardent national will for self-preservation and heroic death-defying courage.
For an alliance is not concluded with arms but with men. Thus, the English
nation will have to be considered the most valuable ally in the world as
long as its leadership and the spirit of its byroad masses justify us in
expecting that brutality and perseverance which is determined to fight a
battle once begun t04 victorious end, with every means and without consideration
of time and sacrifices; and what is more, the military armament existing
at any given moment does not need to stand in any proportion to that of
other states.If we understand that the resurrection of the German nation
represents a question of regaining our political will for self-preservation,
it is also clear that this cannot be done by winning elements which in point
of will at least are already national, but only by the nationalization of
the consciously anti-national masses.A young movement which, therefore, sets itself the goal of resurrecting
a German state with its own sovereignty will have to direct its fight entirely
to winning the broad masses. Wretched as our so-called ' national bourgeoisie
' is on the whole, inadequate as its national attitude seems, certainly
from this side no serious resistance is to be expected against a powerful
domestic and foreign policy in the future. Even if the German bourgeoisie,
for their well-known narrowminded and short-sighted reasons, should, as
they once did toward Bismarck, maintain an obstinate attitude of passive
resistance in the hour of coming liberation- an active resistance, in view
of their recognized and proverbial cowardice, is never to be feared.It is different with the masses of our internationally minded
comrades. In their natural primitiveness, they are snore inclined to the
idea of violence, and, moreover, their Jewish leadership is more brutal
and ruthless. They will crush any German resurrection Just as they once
broke the backbone of the German army. But above all: in this state with
its parliamentary government they will, thanks to their majority in numbers,
not only obstruct any national foreign policy, but also make impossible
any higher estimation of the German strength, thus making us seem uradesirable
as an ally. For not only are we ourselves aware of the element of weakness
lying in our fifteen million Marxists, detmocrats, pacifists, and Centrists;
it is recognized even more by foreign countries, which measure the value
of a possible alliance with us according to the weight of this burden. No
one allies himself with a state in which the attitude of the active part
of the population toward any determined foreign policy is passive, to say
the least.To this we must add the fact that the leaderships of these parties
of national treason must and will be hostile to any resurrection, out of
mere instinct of self-preservation. Historically it is just not conceivable
that the German people could recover its former position without settling
accounts with those who were the cause and occasion of the unprecedented
collapse which struck our state. For before the judgment seat of posterity
November, 1918, will be evaluated, not as high treason, but as treason against
the fatherland.Thus, any possibility of regaining outward German independence
is bound up first and foremost with the recovery of the inner unity of our
people's will.But regarded even from the purely technical point of view, the
idea of an outward German liberation seems senseless as long as the broad
masses are not also prepared to enter the service of this liberating idea.
From the purely military angle, every officer above all will realize after
a moment's thought that a foreign struggle cannot be carried on with student
battalions, that in addition to the brains of a people, the fists are also
needed. In addition, we must bear in mind that a national defense, which
is based only on the circles of the so-called intelligentsia, would squander
irreplaceable treasures. The absence of the young German intelligentsia
which found its death on the fields of Flanders in the fall of 1914 was
sorely felt later on. It was the highest treasure that the German nation
possessed and during the War its loss could no longer be made good. Not
only is it impossible to carry on the struggle itself if the storming battalions
do not find the masses of the workers in their ranks; the technical preparations
are also impracticable without the inner unity of our national will. Especially
our people, doomed to languish along unarmed beneath the thousand eyes of
the Versailles peace treaty, can only make technical preparations for the
achievement of freedom and human independence if the army of domestic stoolpigeons
is decimated down to those whose inborn lack of character permits them to
betray anything and everything for the well-known thirty pieces of silvery
For with these we can deal. Unconquerable by comparison seem the millions
who oppose the national resurrection out of political conviction-unconquerable
as long as the inner cause of their opposition, the international Marxist
philosophy of life, is not combated and torn out of their hearts and brains.Regardless, therefore, from what standpoint we examine the possibility
of regaining our state and national independence, whether frost the standpoint
of preparations in the sphere of foreign policy, from that of technical
armament or that of battle itself, in every case the presupposition for
everything remains the previous winning of the broad masses of our people
for the idea of our national independence.Without the recovery of our external freedom, however, any internal
reform, even in the most favorable case, means only the increase of our
productivity as a colony. The surplus of all socalled economic improvements
falls to the benefit of our international control commissions, and every
social improvement at best raises the productivity of our work for them.
No cultural advances will fall to the share of the German nation; they are
too contingent on the political independence and dignity of our nation.Thus, if a favorable solution of the German future requires
a national attitude on the part of the broad masses of our people, this
must be the highest, mightiest task of a movement whose activity is not
intended to exhaust itself in the satisfaction of the moment, but which
must examine all its commissions and omissions solely with a view to their
presumed consequences in the future.Thus, by 1919 we clearly realized that, as its highest aim,
the new movement must first accomplish the nationalization of the masses.From a tactical standpoint a number of demands resulted from
this.(1) To win the masses for a national resurrection, no social
sacrifice is too great.Whatever economic concessions are made to our working class
today, they stand in no proportion to the gain for the entire nation if
they help to give the broad masses back to their nation. Only pigheaded
short-sightedness, such as is often unfortunately found in our employer
circles, can fail to recognize that in the long run there can be no economic
upswing for them and hence no economic profit, unless the inner national
solidarity of our people is restored.If during the War the German unions had ruthlessly guarded the
interests of the working class, if even during the War they had struck a
thousand times over and forced approval of the demands of the workers they
represented on the dividend-hungry employers of those days; but if in matters
of national defense they had avowed their Germanism with the same fanaticism;
and if with equal ruthlessness they had given to the fatherland that which
is the fatherland's, the War would not have been lost. And how trifiing
all economic concessions, even the greatest, would have been, compared to
the immense importance of winning the War!Thus a movement which plans to give the German worker back to
the German people must clearly realize that in this question economic sacrifices
are of no importance whatever as long as the preservation and independence
of the national economy are not threatened by them.(2) The national education of the broad masses can only take
place indirectly through a social uplift, since thus exclusively can those
general economic premises be created which permit the individual to partake
of the cultural goods of the nation.(3) The nationalization of the broad masses can never be achieved
by half-measures, by weakly emphasizing a socalled objective standpoint,
but only by a ruthless and fanatically onesided orientation toward the goal
to be achieved. That is to say, a people cannot be made 'national' in the
sense understood by our present-day bourgeoisie, meaning with so and so
many limitations, but only nationalistic with the entire vehemence that
is inherent in the extreme. Poison is countered only by an antidote, and
only the shallowness of a-bourgeois mind can regard the middle course as
the road to heaven.The broad masses of a people consist neither of professors nor
of diplomats. The scantiness of the abstract knowledge they possess directs
their sentiments more to the world of feeling. That is where their positive
or negative attitude lies. It is receptive only to an expression of force
in one of these two directions and never to a half-measure hovering between
the two. Their emotional attitude at the same time conditions their extraordinary
stability. Faith is harder to shake than knowledge, love succumbs less to
change than respect, hate is more enduring than aversion, and the impetus
to the mightiest upheavals on this earth has at all times consisted less
in a scientific knowledge dominating the masses than in a fanaticism which
inspired them and sometimes in a hysteria which drove them forward. Anyone
who wants to win the broad masses must know the key that opens the door
to their heart. Its name is not objectivity (read weakness), but will and
power.(4) The soul of the people can only be won if along with carrying
on a positive struggle for our own aims, we destroy the opponent of these
aims.The people at all times see the proof of their own right in
ruthless attack on a foe, and to them renouncing the destruction of the
adversary seems like uncertainty with regard to their own right if not a
sign of their own unriglxt.The broad masses are only a piece of Nature and their sentiment
does not understand the mutual handshake of people who daim that they want
the opposite things. What they desire is the victory of the stronger and
the destruction of the weak or his unconditional subjection.The nationalization of our masses will succeed only when, aside
from all the positive struggle for the soul of our people, their international
poisoners are exterminated.(5) All great questions of the day are questions of the moment
and represent only consequences of definite causes. Only one amongall of
them, however, possesses causal importance,land that is the question of
the racial preservation of the nation. In the blood alone resides the strength
as well as the weakness of man. As long as peoples do not recognize and
give heed to the importance of their racial foundation, they are like men
who would like to teach poodles the qualities of greyhounds, failing to
realize that the speed of the greyhound like the docility of the poodle
are not learned, but are qualities inherent in the race. Peoples which renounce
the preservation of their racial purity renounce with it the unity of their
soul in all its expressions. The divided state of their nature is the natural
consequence of the divided state of their blood, and the change in their
intellectual and creative force is only the effect of the change in their
racial foundations.Anyone who wants to free the German blood from the manifestations
and vices of today, which were originally alien to its nature, will first
have to redeem it from the foreign virus of these manifestations.Without the clearest knowledge of the racial problem and hence
of the Jewish problem there will never be a resurrection of the German nation.The racial question gives the key not only to world history,
but to all human culture.(6) Organizing the broad masses of our people which are today
in the international camp into a national people's community does not mean
renouncing the defense of justified class interests. Divergent class and
professional interests are not synonymous with class cleavages but are natural
consequences of our economic life. Professional grouping is in no way opposed
to a true national community, for the latter consists in the unity of a
nation in all those questions which affect this nation as such.The integration of an occupational group which has become a
class with the national community, or merely with the state, is not accomplished
by the lowering of higher dasses but by uplifting the lower dasses. This
process in turn can never be upheld by the higher class, but only by the
lower class fighting for its equal rights. The present-day bourgeoisie was
not organized into the state by measures of the nobility, but by its own
energy under its own leadership.The German worker will not be raised to the framework of the
German national community via feeble scenes of fraternization, but by a
conscious raising of his social and cultural situation until the most serious
differences may be viewed as bridged. A movement which sets this development
as its goal will have to take its supporters primarily from this camp.'
It may fall back on the intelligentsia only in so far as the latter has
completely understood the goal to be achieved. This process of transformation
and equalization will not be completed in ten or twenty years; experience
shows that it comprises many generations.The severest obstade to the present-day worker's approach to
the national community lies not in the defense of his class interests, but
in his international leadership and attitude which are hostile to the people
and the fatherland. The same unions with a fanatical national leadership
in political and national matters would make millions of workers into the
most valuable members of their nation regardless of the various struggles
that took place over purely economic matters.A movement which wants honestly to give the German worker back
to his people and tear him away from the international delusion must sharply
attack a conception dominant above all in employer circles, which under
national community understands the unresisting economic surrender of the
employee to the employer and which chooses to regard any attempt at safeguarding
even justified interests regarding the employee's economic existence as
an attack on the national community. Such an assertion is not only untrue,
but a conscious lie, because the national community imposes its obligations
not only on one side but also on the other.Just as surely as a worker sins against the spirit of a real
national community when, without regard for the common welfare and the survival
of a national economy, he uses his power to raise extortionate demands,
an employer breaks this community to the same extent when he conducts his
business in an inhuman, exploiting way, misuses the national labor force
and makes millions out of its sweat. He then has no right to designate himself
as national, no right to speak of a national community; no, he is a selfish
scoundrel who induces social unrest and provokes future conflicts which
whatever happens must end in harming the nation.Thus, the reservoir from which the young movement must gather
its supporters will primarily be the masses of our workers. Its work will
be to tear these away from the international delusion, to free them from
their social distress, to raise them out of their cultural misery and lead
them to the national community as a valuable, united factor, national in
feeling and desire.If, in the circles of the national intelligentsia, there are
found men with the warmest hearts for their people and its future, imbued
with the deepest knowledge of the importance of this struggle for the soul
of these masses, they will be highly welcome in the ranks of this movement,
as a valuable spiritual backbone. But winning over the bourgeois voting
cattle can never be the aim of this movement. If it were, it would burden
itself with a dead weight which by its whole nature would paralyze our power
to recruit from the broad masses. For regardless of the theoretical beauty
of the idea of leading together the broadest masses from below and from
above within the framework of the movement, there is the opposing fact that
by psychological propagandizing of bourgeois masses in general meetings,
it may be possible to create moods and even to spread insight, but not to
do away with qualities of character or, better expressed, vices whose development
and origin embrace centuries. The difference with regard to the cultural
level on both sides and the attitude on both sides toward questions raised
by economic interests is at present still so great that, as soon as the
intoxication of the meetings has passed, it would at once manifest itself
as an obstacle.Finally, the goal is not to undertake a reskatification in the
camp that is national to begin with, but to win over the antinational camp.And this point of view, finally, is determining for the tactical
attitude of the whole movement.(7) This one-sided but thereby clear position must express itself
in the propaganda of the movement and on the other hand in turn is required
on propagandist grounds.If propaganda is to be effective for the movement, it must be
addressed to only one quarter, since otherwise, in view of the difference
in the intellectual training of the two camps in question, either it will
not be understood by the one group, or by the other it would be rejected
as obvious and therefore uninterestingEven the style and the tone of its individual products cannot
be equally effective for two such extreme groups. If propaganda renounces
primitiveness of expression, it does not find its way to
the feeling of the broad masses. If, however, in word and gesture, it uses
the masses' harshness of sentiment and expression, it will be rejected by
the so-called intelligentsia as coarse and vulgar. Among a hundred so-called
speakers there are hardly ten capable of speaking with equal effect today
before a public consisting of street.sweepers, locksmiths, sewer-cleaners,
etc., and tomorrow holding a lecture with necessarily the same thought content
in an auditorium full of university professors and students. But among a
thousand speakers there is perhaps only a single one who can manage to speak
to locksmiths and university professors at the same time, in a form which
not only is suitable to the receptivity of both parties, but also influences
both parties with equal effect or actually lashes them into a wild storm
of applause. We must always bear in mind that even the most beautiful idea
of a sublime theory in most cases can be disseminated only through the small
and smallest minds. The important thing is not what the genius who has created
an idea has in mind, but what, in what form, and with what success the proph
ets of this idea transmit it to the broad masses.The strong attractive power of the Social Democracy, yes, of
the whole Marxist movement, rested in large part on the homogeneity and
hence one-sidedness of the public it addressed. The more seemingly limited,
indeed, the narrower its ideas were, the more easily they were taken up
and assimilated by a mass whose intellectual level corresponded to the material
offered.Likewise for the new movement a simple and clear line thus resulted.Propaganda must be adjusted to the broad masses in content and
in form, and its soundness is to be measured exdusively by its effective
result.In a mass meeting of all classes it is not that speaker who
is mentally closest to the intellectuals present who speaks best, but the
one who conquers the heart of the masses.A member of the intelligentsia present at such a meeting, who
carps at the intellectual level of the speech despite the speaker's obvious
effect on the lower strata he has set out to conquer, proves the complete
incapacity of his thinking and the worthlessness of his person for the young
movement. It can use only that intellectual who comprehends the task and
goal of the movement to such an extent that he has learned to judge the
activity of propaganda according to its success and not according to the
impressions which it leaves behind in himself. For propaganda is not intended
to provide entertainment for people who are national-minded to begin with,
but to win the enemies of our nationality, in so far as they are of our
blood.In general those trends of thought which I have briefly summed
up under the heading of war propaganda should be determining and decisive
for our movement in the manner and execution of its own enlightenment work.That it was right was demonstrated by its success(8) The goal of a political reform movement will never be reached
by enlightenment work or by influencing ruling circles, but only by the
achievement of political power. Every world-moving idea has not only the
right, but also the duty, of securing, those means which make possible the
execution of its ideas. Success is the one earthly judge concerning the
right or wrong of such an effort, and under success we must not understand,
as in the year 1918, the achievement of power in itself, but an exercise
of that power that will benefit the nation. Thus, a coup d'etat must not
be regarded as successful if, as senseless state's attorneys in Germany
think today, the revolutionaries have succeeded in possessing themselves
of the state power, but only if by the realization of the purposes and aims
underlying such a revolutionary action, more benefit accrues to the nation
than under the past regime. Something which cannot very well be claimed
for the German revolution, as the gangster job of autumn 1918, calls itself.If the achievement of political power constitutes the precondition
for the practical execution of reform purposes, the movement with reform
purposes must from the first day of its existence feel itself a movement
of the masses and not a literary tea-club or a shopkeepers' bowling society.(9) The young movement is in its nature and inner organization
anti-parliamentarian; that is, it rejects, in general and in its own inner
structure, a principle of majority rule in which the leader is degraded
to the level of a mere executant of other people's will and opinion. In
little as well as big things, the movement advocates the principle of a
Germanic democracy: the leader is elected, but then enjoys unconditional
authority.The practical consequences of this principle in the movement
are the following:The first chairman of a local group is elected, but then he
is the responsible leader of the local group. All committees are subordinate
to him and not, conversely, he to a committee. There are no electoral committees,
but only committees for work. The responsible leader, the first chairman,
organizes the work. The first principle applies to the next higher organization,
the precinct, the district or county. The leader is always elected, but
thereby he is vested with unlimited powers and authority. And, finally,
the same applies to the leadership of the whole party. The chairman is elected,
but he is the exclusive leader of the movements All committees are subordinate
to him and not he to the committees. He makes the decisions and hence bears
the responsibility on his shoulders. Members of the movement are free to
call him to account before the forum of a new election, to divest him of
his office in so far as he has infringed on the principles of the movement
or served its interests badly. His place is then taken by an abler, new
man, enjoying, however} the same authority and the same responsibility.It is one of the highest tasks of the movement to make this
principle determining, not only within its own ranks, but for the entire
state.Any man who wants to be leader bears, along with the highest
unlimited authority, also the ultimate and heaviest responsibility.Anyone who is not equal to this or is too cowardly to bear the
consequences of his acts is not fit to be leader; only the hero is cut out
for this.The progress and culture of humanity are not a product of the
majority, but rest exclusively on the genius and energy of the personality.To cultivate the personality and establish it in its rights
is one of the prerequisites for recovering the greatness and power of our
nationality.Hence the movement is anti-parliamentarian, and even its participation
in a parliamentary institution can only imply activity for its destruction,
for eliminating an institution in which we must see one of the gravest symptoms
of mankind's decay.(10) The movement decisively rejects any position on questions
which either lie outside the frame of its political work or, being not of
basic importance, are irrelevant for it. Its task is not a religious reformation,
but a political reorganization of our people. In both religious denominations
it sees equally valuable pillars for the existence of our people and therefore
combats those parties which want to degrade this foundation of an ethical,
moral, and religious consolidation of our national body to the level of
an instrument of their party interests.The movement finally sees its task, not in the restoration of
a definite state form and in the struggle against another, but in the creation
of those basic foundations without which neither republic nor monarchy can
endure for any length of time. Its mission lies not in the foundation of
a monarchy or in the reinforcement of a republic, but in the creation of
a Germanic state.The question of the outward shaping of this state, its crowning,
so to speak, is not of basic importance, but is determined only by questions
of practical expediency.
For a people that has once understood the great problems and tasks of its
existence, the questions of outward formalities will no longer lead to inner
struggle.(11) The question of the movement's inner organization is one
of expediency and not of principle.
The best organization is not that which inserts the greatest, but that which
inserts the smallest, intermediary apparatus between the leadership of a
movement and its individual adherents. For the function of organization
is the transmission of a definite idea-which always first arises from the
brain of an individual -to a larger body of men and the supervision of its
realization.Hence organization is in all things only a necessary evil. In
the best case it is a means to an end, in the worst case an end in itself.Since the world produces more mechanical than ideal natures,
the forms of organization are usually created more easily than ideas as
such.The practical development of every idea striving for realization
in this world, particularly of one possessing a reform character, is in
its broad outlines as follows:Some idea of genius arises in the brain of a man who feels called
upon to transmit his knowledge to the rest of humanity. He preaches his
view and gradually wins a certain circle of adherents. This process of the
direct and personal transmittance of a man's ideas to the rest of his fellow
men l is the most ideal and natural. With the rising increase in the adherents
of the new doctrine, it gradually becomes impossible for the exponent of
the idea to go on exerting a personal, direct influence on the innumerable
supporters, to lead and direct them. Proportionately as, in consequence
of the growth of the community, the direct and shortest communication is
excluded, the necessity of a connecting organization arises: thus, the ideal
condition is ended and is replaced by the necessary evil of organization.
Little sub-groups are formed which in the political movement, for example,
call themselves local groups and constitute the germ-cells of the future
organization.If the unity of the doctrine is not to be lost, however, this
subdivision must not take place until the authority of the spiritual founder
and of the school trained by him can be regarded as unconditional. The geo-political
significance of a focal center in a movement cannot be overemphasized. Only
the presence of such a place, exerting the magic spell of a Mecca or a Rome,
can in the long run give the movement a force which is based on inner unity
and the recognition of a summit representing this unity.Thus, in forming the first organizational germ-cells we must
never lose sight of the necessity, not only of preserving the importance
of the original local source of the idea, but of making it paramount. This
intensification of the ideal, moral, and factual immensity of the movement's
point of origin and direction must take place in exact proportion as the
movement's germcells, which have now become innumerable, demand new links
in the shape of organizational forms.For, as the increasing number of individual adherents makes
it impossible to continue direct communication with them for the formation
of the lowest bodies, the ultimate innumerable increase of these lowest
organizational forms compels in turn creation of higher associations which
politically can be designated roughly as county or district groups.Easy as it still may be to maintain the authority of the original
center toward the lowest local groups, it will be equally difficult to maintain
this position toward the higher organizational forms which now arise. But
this is the precondition for the unified existence of the movement and hence
for carrying out an idea.If, finally, these larger intermediary divisions are also combined
into new organizational forms, the difficulty is further increased of safeguarding,
even toward them, the unconditional leading character of the original founding
site, its school, etc.Therefore, the mechanical forms of an organization may only
be developed to the degree in which the spiritual ideal authority of a center
seems unconditionally secured. In political formations this guaranty can
often seem provided only by practical power.From this the following directives for the inner structure of
the movement resulted:(a) Concentration for the time being of all activity in a single
place: Munich. Training of a community of unconditionally reliable supporters
and development of a school for the subsequent dissemination of the idea.
Acquisition of the necessary authority for the future by the greatest possible
visible successes in this one place.To make the movement and its leaders known, it was necessary,
not only to shake the belief in the invincibility of the Marxist doctrine
in one place for all to see, but to demonstrate the possibility of an opposing
movement.(b) Formation of local groups only when the authority of the
central leadership in Munich may be regarded as unquestionably recognized.(c) Likewise the formation of district, county, or provincial
groups depends, not only on the need for them, but also on certainty that
an unconditional recognition of the center has been achieved.
Furthermore, the creation of organizational forms is dependent on the men
who are available and can be considered as leaders
This may occur in two ways:
(a) The movement disposes of the necessary financial means for the training
and schooling of minds capable of future leadership. It then distributes
the material thus acquired systematically according to criteria of tactical
and other expediency.
This way is the easier and quicker; however, it demands great financial
means, since this leader material is only able to work for the movement
when paid.
(b) The movement, owing to the lack of financial means, is not in a position
to appoint official leaders, but for the present must depend on honorary
officers.This way is the slower and more difficult.Under certain circumstances the leadership of a movement must
let large territories lie fallow, unless there emerges from the adherents
a man able and willing to put himself at the disposal of the leadership,
and organize and lead the movement in the district in question.It may happen that in large territories there will be no one,
in other places, however, two or even three almost equally capable. The
difficulty that lies in such a development is great and can only be overcome
in the course of years.The prerequisite for the creation of an organizational form
is and remains the man necessary for its leadership.As worthless as an army in all its organizational forms is without
officers, equally worthless is a political organization without the suitable
leader.Not founding a local group is more useful to the movement when
a suitable leader personality is lacking than to have its organization miscarry
due to the absence of a leader to direct and drive it forward.Leadership itself requires not only will but also ability, and
a greater importance must be attached to will and energy than to intelligence
as such, and most valuable of all is a combination of ability, determination,
and perseverance.(12) The future of a movement is conditioned by the fanaticism
yes, the intolerance, with which its adherents uphold it as the sole correct
movement, and push it past other formations of a similar sort.It is the greatest error to believe that the strength of a movement
increases through a union with another of similar character. It is true
that every enlargement of this kind at first means an increase in outward
dimensions, which to the eyes of superficial observers means power; in truth,
however, it only takes over the germs of an inner weakening that will later
become effective.For whatever can be said about the like character of two movements,
in reality it is never present. For otherwise there would actually be not
two movements but one. And regardless wherein the differences lie-even if
they consisted only in the varying abilities of the leadership-they exist.
But the natural law of all development demands, not the coupling of two
formations which are simply not alike, but the victory of the stronger and
the cultivation of the victor's force and strength made possible alone by
the resultant struggle.Through the union of two more or less equal political party
formations momentary advantages may arise, but in the long run any success
won in this way is the cause of inner weaknesses which appear later.The greatness of a movement is exclusively guaranteed by the
unrestricted development of its inner strength and its steady growth up
to the final victory over all competitors.Yes, we can say that its strength and hence the justification
of its existence increases only so long as it recognizes the principle of
struggle as the premise of its development, and that it has passed the high
point of its strength in the moment when complete victory inclines to its
side.Therefore, it is only profitable for a movement to strive for
this victory in a form which does not lead to an early momentary success,
but which in a long struggle occasioned by absolute intolerance also provides
long growth.Movements which increase only by the so-called fusion of similar
formations, thus owing their strength to compromises, are like hothouse
plants. They shoot up, but they lack the strength to defy the centuries
and withstand heavy storms.The greatness of every mighty organization embodying an idea
in this world lies in the religious fanaticism and intolerance with which,
fanatically convinced of its own right, it intolerantly imposes its will
against all others. If an idea in itself is sound and, thus armed, takes
up a struggle on this earth, it is unconquerable and every persecution will
only add to its inner strength.The greatness of Christianity did not lie in attempted negotiations
for compromise with any similar philosophical opinions in the ancient world,
but in its inexorable fanaticism in preaching and fighting for its own doctrine.The apparent head start which movements achieve by fusions is
amply caught up with by the steady increase in the strength of a doctrine
and organization that remain independent and fight their own fight.(13) On principle the movement must so educate its members that
they do not view the struggle as something idly cooked up, but as the thing
that they themselves are striving ford Therefore, they must not fear the
hostility of their enemies, but must feel that it is the presupposition
for their own right to exist. They must not shun the hatred of the enemies
of our nationality and our philosophy and its manifestations; they must
long for them. And among the manifestations of this hate are lies and slander.Any man who is not attacked in the Jewish newspapers, not slandered
and vilified, is no decent German and no true National Socialist. The best
yardstick for the value of his attitude, for the sincerity of his conviction,
and the force of his will is the hostility he receives from the mortal enemy
of our people.It must, over and over again, be pointed out to the adherents
of the movement and in a broader sense to the whole people that the Jew
and his newspapers always lie and that even an occasional Ruth is only intended
to cover a bigger falsification and is therefore itself in turn a deliberate
untruth. The Jew is the great master in lying, and lies and deception are
his weapons in struggle.
Every Jewish slander and every Jewish lie is a scar of honor on the body
of our warriors.The man they have most reviled stands closest to us and the
man they hate worst is our best friend.Anyone who picks up a Jewish newspaper in the morning and does
not see himself slandered in it has not made profitable use of the previous
day; for if he had, he would be persecuted, reviled, slandered, abused}
befouled. And only the man who combats this mortal enemy of our nation and
of all Aryan humanity and culture most effectively may expect to see the
slanders of this race and the struggle of this people directed against him.When these principles enter the flesh and blood of our supporters,
the movement will become unshakable and invincible.(14) The movement must promote respect for personality by all
means; it must never forget that in personal worth lies the worth of everything
human; that every idea and every achievement is the result of one man's
creative force and that the admiration of greatness constitutes, not only
a tribute of thanks to the latter, but casts a unifying bond around the
grateful.Personality cannot be replaced; especially when it embodies
not the mechanical but the cultural and creative element. No more than a
famous master can be replaced and another take over the completion of the
half-finished painting he has left behind can the great poet and thinker,
the great statesman and the great soldier, be replaced. For their activity
lies always in the province of art. It is not mechanically trained, but
inborn by God's grace.The greatest revolutionary changes and achievements of this
earth its greatest cultural accomplishments the immortal deeds in the field
of statesmanship, etc., are forever inseparably bound up with a name and
are represented by it. To renounce doing homage to a great spirit means
the loss of an immense strength which emanates from the names of all great
men and women.The Jew knows this best of all. He, whose great men are only
great in the destruction of humanity and its culture, makes sure that they
are idolatrously admired. He attempts only to represent the admiration of
the nations for their own spirits as unworthy and brands it as a 'personality
cult.'As soon as a people becomes so cowardly that it succumbs to
this Jewish arrogance and effrontery, it renounces the mightiest power that
it possesses; for this is based, not on respect for the masses, but on the
veneration of genius and on uplift and enlightenment by his example.When human hearts break and human souls-despair, then from the
twilight of the past the great conquerors of distress and care, of disgrace
and misery, of spiritual slavery and physical compulsion, look down on them
and hold out their eternal hands to the despairing mortals!Woe to the people that is ashamed to take them!In the first period of our movement's development we suffered
from nothing so much as from the insignificance, the unknownness of our
names, which in themselves made our success questionable. The hardest thing
in this first period, when often only six, seven, or eight heads met together
to use the words of an opponent, was to arouse and preserve in this tiny
circle faith in the mighty future of the movement.Consider that six or seven men, all nameless poor devils, had
joined together with the intention of forming a movement hoping to succeed-where
the powerful great mass parties had hitherto failed-in restoring a German
Reich of greater power and glory. If people had attacked us in those days,
yes, even if they had laughed at us, in both cases we should have been happy.
For the oppressive thing was neither the one nor the other; it was the complete
lack of attention we found in those days.When I entered the circle of these few men, there could be no
question of a party or a movement. I have already described my impressions
regarding my first meeting with this little formation. In the weeks that
followed, I had time and occasion to study this so-called 'party' which
at first looked so impossible. And, by God the picture was depressing and
discouraging. There was nothing here, really positively nothing. The name
of a party whose committee constituted practically the whole membership,
which, whether we liked it or not, was exactly what it was trying to combat,
a parliament on a small scale. Here, too, the vote ruled; if big parliaments
yelled their throats hoarse for months at a time, it was about important
problems at least, but in this little circle the answer to a safely arrived
letter let loose an interminable argument!The public, of course, knew nothing at all about this. Not a
soul in Munich knew the party even by name, except for its few supporters
and their few friends.Every Wednesday a so-called committee meeting took place in
a Munich cafe, and once a week an evening lecture. Since the whole membership
of the 'movement' was at first represented in the committee, the faces of
course were always the same. Now the task was at last to burst the bonds
of the small circle, to win new supporters, but above all to make the name
of the movement known at any price.In this we used the following technique:Every month, and later every two weeks, we tried to hold a 'meeting.'
The invitations to it were written on the typewriter or sometimes by hand
on slips of paper and the first few times were distributed, or handed out,
by us personally. Each one of us turned to the circle of his friends, and
tried to induce someone or other to attend one of these affairs.The result was miserable.I still remember how I myself in this first period once distributed
about eighty of these slips of paper, and how in the evening we sat waiting
for the masses who were expected to appear.
An hour late, the ' chairman ' finally had to open the 'meeting.' We were
again seven men, the old seven.We changed over to having the invitation slips written on a
machine and mimeographed in a Munich stationery store. The result at the
next meeting was a few more listeners. Thus the number rose slowly from
eleven to thirteen, finally to seventeen, to twenty-three, to thirty-four
listeners.By little collections among us poor devils the funds were raised
with which at last to advertise the meeting by notices in the then independent
Munchener Beobachter in Munich. And this time the success was positively
amazing. We had organized the meeting in the Munich Hofbrauhauskeller (not
to be confused with the Munich Hofbrauhaus-Festsaal), a little room with
a capacity of barely one hundred and thirty people. To me personally the
room seemed like a big hall and each of us was worried whether we would
succeed in filling this 'mighty' edifice with people.At seven o'clock one hundred and eleven people were present
and the meeting was opened. A Munich professor made the main speech, and I, for the first
time, in public, was to speak second.In the eyes of Herr Harrer, then first chairman of the party,
the affair seemed a great adventure. This gentleman, who was certainly otherwise
honest, just happened to be convinced that I might be capable of doing certain
things, but not of speaking. And even in the time that followed he could
not be dissuaded from this opinion. "Things turned out differently. In this first meeting that could
be called public I had been granted twenty minutes' speaking time.I spoke for thirty minutes, and what before I had simply felt
within me, without in any way knowing it, was now proved by reality: I could
speak After thirty minutes the people in the small room were electrified
and the enthusiasm was first expressed by the fact that my appeal to the
self-sacrifice of those present led to the donation of three hundred marks.
This relieved us of a great worry. For at this time the financial stringency
was so great that we were not even in a position to have slogans printed
for the movement, or even distribute leaflets. Now the foundation was laid
for a little fund from which at least our barest needs and most urgent necessities
could be defrayed. But in another respect as well, the success of this first
larger meeting was considerable.
At that time I had begun to bring a number of fresh young forces into the
committee. During my many years in the army I -had come to know a great
number of faithful comrades who now slowly, on the basis of my persuasion,
began to enter the movement. They were all energetic young people, accustomed
to discipline, and from their period of service raised in the principle:
nothing at all is impossible, everything can be done if you only want it.How necessary such a transfusion of new blood was, I myself
could recognize after only a few weeks of collaboration.Herr Harrer, then first chairman of the party, was really a
journalist and as such he was certainly widely educated. But for a party
leader he had one exceedingly serious drawback: he was no speaker for the
masses. As scrupulously conscientious and precise as his work in itself
was, it nevertheless lacked-perhaps because of this very lack of a great
oratorical gift-the great sweep. Herr Drexler, then chairman of the Munich
local group, was a simple worker, likewise not very significant as a speaker,
and moreover he was no soldier. He had not served in the army, even during
the War he had not been a soldier, so that feeble and uncertain as he was
in his whole nature, he lacked the only schooling which was capable of turning
uncertain and soft natures into men. Thus both men were not made of stuff
which would have enabled them not only to bear in their hearts fanatical
faith in the victory of a movement, but also with indomitable energy and
will, and if necessary with brutal ruthlessness, to sweep aside any obstacles
which might stand in the path of the rising new idea. For this only beings
were fitted in whom spirit and body had acquired those military virtues
which can perhaps best be described as follows: swift as greyhounds, tough
as leather, and hard as Krupp steel.At that time I myself was still a soldier. My exterior and interior
had been whetted and hardened for well-nigh six years, so that at first
I must have seemed strange in this circle. I, too, had forgotten how to
say: 'that's impossible,' or 'it won't work'; 'we can't risk that,' 'that
is too dangerous,' etc.For of course the business was dangerous. Little attention as
the Reds paid to one of your bourgeois gossip clubs whose inner innocence
and hence harmlessness for themselves theyknew better than its own members,
they were determined to use every means to get rid of a movement which did
seem dangerous to them. Their most effective method in such cases has at
all times been terror or violence.In the year 1920, in many regions of Germany, a national meeting
that dared to address its appeal to the broad masses and publicly invite
attendance was simply impossible. The participants in such a meeting were
dispersed and driven away with bleeding heads. Such an accomplishment, to
be sure, did not require much skill: for after all the biggest so-called
bourgeois mass meeting would scatter at the sight of a dozen Communists
like hares running from a hound.Most loathsome to the Marxist deceivers of the people was inevitably
a movement whose explicit aim was the winning of those masses which had
hitherto stood exclusively in the service of the international Marxist Jewish
stock exchange parties. The very name of ' German Workers' Party ' had the
effect of goading them. Thus one could easily imagine that on the first
suitable occasion the conflict would begin with the Marxist inciters who
were then still drunk with victory.In the small circle that the movement then was a certain fear
of such a fight prevailed. The members wanted to appear in public as little
as possible, for fear of being beaten up. In their mind's eye they already
saw the first great meeting smashed and go the movement finished for good.
I had a hard time putting forward my opinion that we must not dodge this
struggle, but prepare for it, and for this reason acquire the armament which
alone offers protection against violence. Terror is not broken by the mind,
but by terror. The success of the first meeting strengthened my position
in this respect. We gained courage for a second meeting on a somewhat larger
scale.About October, 1919, the second, larger meeting took place in
the Eberlbraukeller. Topic: Brestlitovsk and Versailles. Four gentlemen
appeared as speakers. I myself spoke for almost an hour and the success
was greater than at the first rally. The audience had risen to more than
one hundred and thirty. An attempted disturbance was at once nipped in the
bud by my comrades. The diturbers flew down the stairs with gashed heads.Two weeks later another meeting took place in the same hall.
The attendance had risen to over one hundred and seventy and the room was
well filled. I had spoken again, and again the success was greater than
at the previous meeting.I pressed for a larger hall. At length we found one at the other
end of town in the 'Deutsches Reich' on Dachauer Strasse. The first meeting
in the new hall was not so well attended as the previous one: barely one
hundred and forty persons. In the committee, hopes began to sink and the
eternal doubters felt that the excessive repetition of our 'demonstrations'
had to be considered the cause of the bad attendance. There were violent
arguments in which I upheld the view that a city of seven hundred thousand
inhabitants could stand not one meeting every two weeks, but ten every week,
that we must not let ourselves be misled by failures, that the road we had
taken was the right
one, and that sooner or later, with steady perseverance, success was bound
to come. All in all, this whole period of winter 1919-20 was a single struggle
to strengthen confidence in the victorious might of the young movement and
raise it to that fanaticism of faith which can move mountains.The next meeting in the same hall showed me to be right. The
attendance had risen to over two hundred; the public as well as financial
success was brilliant.I urged immediate preparations for another meeting. It took
place barely two weeks later and the audience rose to over two hundred and
seventy heads.Two weeks later, for the seventh time, we called together the
supporters and friends of the new movement and the same hall could barely
hold the people who had grown to over four hundred.It was at this time that the young movement received its inner
form. In the small circle there were sometimes more or less violent disputes.
Various quarters-then as today-carped at designating the young movement
as a party. In such a conception I have always seen proof of the critics'
practical incompetence and intellectual smallness. They were and always
are the men who cannot distinguish externals from essentials, and who try
to estimate the value of a movement according to the most bombastic-sounding
titles, most of which, sad to say, the vocabulary of our forefathers must
provide.It was hard, at that time, to make it clear to people that every
movement, as long as it has not achieved the victory of its ideas, hence
its goal, is a party even if it assumes a thousand different names.If any man wants to put into practical effect a bold idea whose
realization seems useful in the interests of his fellow men, he will first
of all have to seek supporters who are ready to fight for his intentions.
And if this intention consists only in destroying the existing parties,
of ending the fragmentation, the exponents of this view and propagators
of this determination are themselves a party, as long as this goal has not
been achieved. It is hair-splitting and shadow-boxing when some antiquated
folkish theoretician, whose practical successes stand in inverse proportion
to his wisdom, imagines that he can change the party character which every
young movement possesses by changing this term.On the contrary.If anything is unfolkish, it is this tossing around of old Germanic
expressions which neither fit into the present period nor represent anything
definite, but can easily lead to seeing the significance of a movement in
its outward vocabulary. This is a real menace which today can be observed
on countless occasions.Altogether then, and also in the period that followed, I had
to warn again and again against those deutschvolkisch wandering scholars
whose positive accomplishment is always practically nil, but whose conceit
can scarcely be excelled. The young movement had and still has to guard
itself against an influx of people whose sole recommendation for the most
part lies in their declaration that they have fought for thirty and even
forty years for the same idea. Anyone who fights for forty years for a so-called
idea without being able to bring about even the slightest success, in fact,
without having prevented the victory of the opposite, has, with forty years
of activity, provided proof of his own incapacity. The danger above all
lies in the fact that such natures do not want to fit into the movement
as links, but keep shooting off their mouths about leading circles in which
alone, on the strength of their age-old activity, they can see a suitable
place for further activity. But woe betide if a young movement is surrended
to the mercies of such people. No more than a business man who in forty
years of activity has steadily run a big business into the ground is fitted
to be the founder of a new one, is a folkish Methuselah, who in exactly
the same time has gummed up and petrified a great idea, fit for the leadership
of a new, young movement!Besides, only a fragment of all these people come into the new
movement to serve it, but in most cases, under its protection or through
the possibilities it offers, to warm over their old cabbageThey do not want to benefit the idea of the new doctrine, they
only expect it to give them a chance to make humanity miserable with their
own ideas. For what kind of ideas they often are, it is hard to tell.The characteristic thing about these people is that they rave
about old Germanic heroism, about dim prehistory, stone axes spear and shield,
but in reality are the greatest cowards that can be imagined. For the same
people who brandish scholarly imitations of old German tin swords, and wear
a dressed bearskin with bull's horns over their bearded heads, preach for
the present nothing but struggle with spiritual weapons, and run away as
fast as they can from every Communist blackjack. Posterity will have little
occasion to glorify their own heroic existence in a new epic.I came to know these people too well not to feel the profoundest
disgust at their miserable play-acting. But they make a ridiculous impression
on the broad masses, and the Jew has every reason to spare these folkish
comedians, even to prefer them to the true fighters for a coming German
state. With all this, these people are boundlessly conceited; despite all
the proofs of their complete incompetence, they daim to know everything
better and become a real plague for all straightforward and honest fighters
to whom heroism seems worth honoring, not only in the past, but who also
endeavor to give posterity a similar picture by their own actions.And often it can be distinguished only with difficulty which
of these people act out of inner stupidity or incompetence and which only
pretend to for certain reasons. Especially with the so-called religious
reformers on an old Germanic basis, I always have the feeling that they
were sent by those powers which do not want the resurrection of our people.
For their whole activity leads the people away from the common struggle
against the common enemy, the Jew, and instead lets them waste their strength
on inner religious squabbles as senseless as they are disastrous. For these
very reasons the establishment of a strong central power implying the unconditional
authority of a Kadership is necessary in the movement. By it alone can such
ruinous elements be squelched. And for this reason the greatest enemies
of a uniform, strictly led and conducted movement are to be found in the
circles of these folkish wandering Jews. In the movement they hate the power
that checks their mischief.Not for nothing did the young movement establish a definite
program in which it did not use the word 'folkish.' The concept folkish,
in view of its conceptual boundlessness, is no possible basis for a movement
and offers no standard for membership in one. The more indefinable this
concept is in practice, the more and broader interpretations it permits,
the greater becomes the possibility of invoking its authority. The insertion
of such an indefinable and variously interpretable concept into the political
struggle leads to the destruction of any strict fighting solidarity, since
the latter does not permit leaving to the individual the definition of his
faith and will.And it is disgraceful to see all the people who run around today
with the word 'folkish' on their caps and how many have their own interpretation
of this concept. A Bavarian professor by the name of Bayer,l a famous fighter
with spiritual weapons, rich in equally spiritual marches on Berlin, thinks
that the concept folkish consists only in a monarchistic attitude. This
learned mind, however, has thus far forgotten to give a closer explanation
of the identity of our German monarchs of the past with the folkish opinion
of today. And I fear that in this the gentleman would not easily succeed.
For anything less folkish than most of the Germanic monarchic state formations
can hardly be imagined. If this were not so, they would never have disappeared,
or their disappearance would offer proof of the unsoundness of the folkish
outlook.And so everyone shoots off his mouth about this concept as he
happens to understand it. As a basis for a movement of political struggle,
such a multiplicity of opinions is out of the question.I shall not even speak of the unworldliness of these folkish
Saint Johns of the twentieth century or their ignorance of the popular soul.
It is sufliciently illustrated by the ridicule with which they are treated
by the Left, which lets them talk and iaughs at them.Anyone in this world who does not succeed in being hated by
his adversaries does not seem to me to be worth much as a friend. And thus
the friendship of these people for our young movement was not only worthless,
but solely and always harmful, and it was also the main reason why, first
of all, we chose the name of 'party'-we had grounds for hoping that by this
alone a whole swarm of these folkish sleepwalkers would be frightened away
from us-and why in the second place we termed ourselves National Socialist
German Workers' Party.The first expression kept away the antiquity enthusiasts, the
big-mouths and superficial proverb-makers of the so-called folkish idea,'
and the second freed us from the entire host of knights of the 'spiritual
sword,' all the poor wretches who wield the 'spiritual weapon' as a protecting
shield to hide their actual cowardice.It goes without saying that in the following period we were
attacked hardest especially by these last, not actively, of course, but
only with the pen, just as you would expect from such folkish goose-quills.
For them our principle, 'Against those who attack us with force we will
defend ourselves with force,' had something terrifying about it. They persistently
reproached us, not only with brutal worship of the blackjack, but with lack
of spirit as such. The fact that in a public meeting a Demosthenes can be
brought to silence if only fifty idiots, supported by their voices and their
fists, refuse to let him speak, makes no impression whatever on such a quack.
His inborn cowardice never lets him get into such danger. For he does not
work 'noisily' and 'obtrusively,' but in 'silence.' Even today r cannot warn our young movement enough against falling
into the net of these so-called 'silent workers.' They are not only cowards,
but they are also always incompetents and do-nothings. A man who knows a
thing, who is aware of a given danger, and sees the possibility of a remedy
with his own eyes, has the duty and obligation, by God, not to work 'silently,'
but to stand up before the whole public against the evil and for its cure.
If he does not do so, he is a disloyal, miserable weakling who fails either
from cowardice or from laziness and inability. To be sure, this does not
apply at all to most of these people, for they know absolutely nothing,
but behave as though they knew God knows what; they can do nothing but try
to swindle the whole world with their tricks; they are lazy, but with the
'silent' work they claim to do, they arouse the impression of an enormous
and conscientious activity; in short, they are swindlers, political crooks
who hate the honest work of others. As soon as one of these folkish moths
praises the darkness 1 of silence, we can bet a thousand to one that by
it he produces nothing, but steals, steals from the fruits of other people's
work.
To top all this, there is the arrogance and conceited effrontery with which
this lazy, light-shunning rabble fall upon the work of others, trying to
criticize it from above, thus in reality aiding the mortal enemies of our
nationality.
Every last agitator who possesses the courage to stand on a tavern table
among his adversaries, to defend his opinions with manly forthrightness,
does more than a thousand of these lying, treacherous sneaks. He will surely-
be able to convert one man or another and win him for the movement. It will
be possible to examine his achievement and establish the effect of his activity
by its results. Only the cowardly swindlers who praise their 'silent' work
and thus wrap themselves in the protective cloak of a despicable anonymity,
are good for nothing and may in the truest sense of the word be considered
drones in the resurrection of ourpeople.
# #At the beginning of 1920, I urged the holding of the first great
mass meeting. Differences of opinion arose. A few leading party members
regarded the affair as premature and hence disastrous in effect. The Red
press had begun to concern itself with us and we were fortunate enough gradually
to achieve its hatred. We had begun to speak in the discussions at other
meetings. Of course, each of us was at once shouted down. There was, however,
some success. People got to know us and proportionately as their knowledge
of us deepened, the aversion and rage against us grew. And thus we were
entitled to hope that in our first great mass meeting we would be visited
by a good many of our friends from the Red camp.I, too, realized that there was great probability of the meeting
being broken up. But the struggle had to be carried through, if not now,
a few months later. It was entirely in our power to make the movement eternal
on the very first day by blindly and ruthlessly fighting for it. I knew
above all the mentality of the adherents of the Red side far too well, not
to know that resistance to the utmost not only makes the biggest impression,
but also wins supporters. And so we just had to be resolved to put up this
resistance.Herr Harrer,l then first chairman of the party, felt he could
not support my views with regard to the time chosen and consequently, being
an honest, upright man, he withdrew from the leadership of the party. His
place was taken by Herr Anton Drexler. I had reserved for myself the organization
of propaganda and began ruthlessly to carry it out.And so, the date of February 4, 19202 was set for the holding
of this first great mass meeting of the still unknown movement.I personally conducted the preparations. They were very brief.
Altogether the whole apparatus was adjusted to make lightning decisions.
Its aim was to enable us to take a position on current questions in the
form of mass meetings within twenty-four hours. They were to be announced
by posters and leaflets whose content was determined according to those
guiding principles which in rough outlines I have set down in my treatise
on propaganda. Effect on the broad masses, concentration on a few points,
constant repetition of the same, self-assured and self-reliant framing of
the text in the forms of an apodictic statement, greatest perseverance in
distribution and patience in awaiting the effect.On principle, the color red was chosen; it is the most exciting;
we knew it would infuriate and provoke our adversaries the most and thus
bring us to their attention and memory whether they liked it or not.In the following period the inner fraternization in Bavaria
between the Marxists and the Center as a political party was most clearly
shown in the concern with which the ruling Bavarian People's Party tried
to weaken the effect of our posters on the Red working masses and later
to prohibit them. If the police found no other way to proceed against them,
'considerations of traffic' had to do the trick, till finally, to please
the inner, silent Red ally, these posters, which had given back hundreds
of thousands of workers, incited and seduced by internationalism, to their
German nationality, were forbidden entirely with the helping hand of a so-called
German National People's Party. As an appendix and example to our young
movement, I am adding a number of these proclamations. They come from a
period embracing nearly three years; they can best illustrate the mighty
struggle which the young movement fought at this time. They will also bear
witness to posterity of the will and honesty of our convictions and the
despotism of the so-called national authorities in prohibiting, just because
they personally found it uncomfortable, a nationalization which would have
won back broad masses of our nationality.They will also help to destroy the opinion that there had been
a national government as such in Bavaria and also document for posterity
the fact that the national Bavaria of 1919, 1920, 1921 1922, 1923 was not
forsooth the result of a national government, but that the government was
merely forced to take consideration of a people that was gradually feeling
nationalThe governments themselves did everything to eliminate this
process of recovery and to make it impossible.Here only two men must be excluded:Ernst Pohner, the police president at that tirne, and Chief
Deputy frick his faithful advisor, were the only higher state officials
who even then had the courage to be first Germans and then officials. Ernst
Pohner was the only man in a responsible post who did not curry favor with
the masses, but felt responsible to his nationality and was ready to risk
and sacrifice everything, even if necessary his personal existence, for
the resurrection of the German people whom he loved above all things. And
for this reason he was always a troublesome thorn in the eyes of those venal
officials the law of whose actions was prescribed, not by the interest of
their people and the necessary uprising for its freedom, but by the boss's
orders, without regard for the welfare of the national trust confided in
them.And above all he was one of those natures who, contrasting with
most of the guardians of our so-called state authority, do not fear the
enmity of traitors to the people and the nation, but long for it as for
a treasure which a decent man must take for granted. The hatred of Jews
and Marxists, their whole campaign of lies and slander, were for him the
sole happiness amid the misery of our people.
A man of granite honesty, of antique simplicity and German straightforwardness,
for whom the words 'Sooner dead than a slave ' were no phrase but the essence
of his whole being.He and his collaborator, Dr. Frick, are in my eyes the only
men in a state position who possess the right to be called cocreators of
a national Bavaria.Before we proceeded to hold our first mass meeting, not only
did the necessary propaganda material have to be made ready, but the main
points of the program also had to be put into print.In the second volume I shall thoroughly develop the guiding
principles which we had in mind, particularly in framing the program. Here
I shall only state that it was done, not only to give the young movement
form and content, but to make its aims understandable to the broad masses.Circles of the so-called intelligentsia have mocked and ridiculed
this and attempted to criticize it. But the soundness of our point of view
at that time has been shown by the effectiveness of this program.In these years I have seen dozens of new movements arise and
thev have all vanished and evaporated without trace. A single one remains:
The National Socialist German Workers' Party. And today more than ever I
harbor the conviction that people can combat it, that they can attempt to
paralyze it, that petty party ministers can forbid us to speak and write,
but that they will never prevent the victory of our ideas.When not even memory will reveal the names of the entire present-day
state conception and its advocates, the fundamentals of the National Socialist
program will be the foundations of a coming state.Our four months' activities at meetings up to January, 1920,
had slowly enabled us to save up the small means that we needed for printing
our first leaflet, our first poster, and our program.If I take the movement's first large mass meeting as the conclusion
of this volume, it is because by it the party burst the narrow bonds of
a small club and for the first time exerted a determining infiuence on the
mightiest factor of our tirne, public opinion.I myself at that time had but one concern: Will the hall be
filled, or will we speak to a yawning hall? 1 I had the unshakable l inner
conviction that if the people came, the day was sure to be a great success
for the young movement. And so I anxiously looked forward to that evening.The meeting was to be opened at 7:30. At 7:15 I entered the
Festsaal of the Hofbrauhaus on the Platzl in Munich, and my heart nearly
burst for joy. The gigantic hall-for at that time it still seemed to me
gigantic-was overcrowded with people, shoulder to shoulder, a mass numbering
almost two thousand people. And above all-those people to whom we wanted
to appeal had come. Far more than half the hall seemed to be occupied by
Communists and Independents. They had resolved that our first demonstration
would come to a speedy end.But it turned out differently. After the first speaker had finished,
I took the floor. A few minutes later there was a hail of shouts, there
were violent dashes in the hall, a handful of the most faithful war comrades
and other supporters battled with the disturbers, and only little by little
were able to restore order.I was able to go on speaking. After half an hour the applause
slowly began to drown out the screaming and shouting.I now took up the program and began to explain it for the first
time.From minute to minute the interruptions were increasingly drowned
out by shouts of applause. And when I finally submitted the twenty-five
theses, point for point, to the masses and asked them personally to pronounce
judgment on them, one after another was accepted with steadily mounting
joy, unanimously and again unanimously, and when the last thesis had found
its way to the heart of the masses, there stood before me a hall full of
people united by a new conviction, a new faith, a new will.When after nearly four hours the hall began to empty and the
crowd, shoulder to shoulder, began to move, shove, press toward the exit
like a slow stream, I knew that now the principles of a movement which could
no longer be forgotten were moving out among the German people.
A fire was kindled from whose flame one day the sword must come which would
regain freedom for the Germanic Siegfried and life for the German nation.And side by side with the coming resurrection, I sensed that
the goddess of inexorable vengeance for the perjured deed of November 9,
1919, was striding forth.Thus slowly the hall emptied.The movement took its course.
