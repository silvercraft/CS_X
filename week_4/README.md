Homework for week 4 Using a webcrawler to fetch individual urls,read the text,and find out the frequency of the words to make a word cloud. Link:https://silvercraft.github.io/CS_X/week_4/hw_4/hw_4.html My computer couldn't seem to process too much webpage at onces,so I ended up choosing only the debut album. The report indicates the most frequent words used in the lyrics.
